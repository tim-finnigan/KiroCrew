"""The resume pin is threaded, not re-derived: a structural inventory.

A message that reaches a Discord, Telegram or Teams conversation is pinned ONCE at
admission to the session it runs in (``session_resume.ResumeBinding``), and every
later step that could route it takes that pin -- the steer-or-queue busy path, the
queue entry, the retry after a false enqueue, the turn itself, the drain's replay.
(The hand-off into a busy RESUMED session, ``_handle_resumed_busy``, is handed the
pin's resolved key: it routes nothing and replays nothing.) Three heads in a row carried a variant of the same
defect (a stale binding check, a check that ran before the awaits, a retry that
re-routed), each fixed at its site; this pin exists so that no call site CAN route
unpinned, and this test is what keeps it that way: it reads the dispatchers' source
and asserts, for every call site of the pinned helpers, that the pin is what they
receive. A new call site fails here until it is classified below.
