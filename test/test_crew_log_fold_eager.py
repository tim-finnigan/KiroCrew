"""Per-fold savepoint versions, and the eager folding mode built on them.

Three properties, each the reason one piece of the change exists.

A fold's stored shape is ITS OWN, so retiring one fold's savepoints costs a cold
fold to that fold and nothing to the others
(:func:`test_bumping_one_folds_version_retires_only_that_folds_savepoint`). Under the
single global number every bump retired all six, so a counting fix in one fold made
every long session refold every fold it had.

An EAGER fold may never be one that every entry moves
(:func:`test_an_eager_fold_must_declare_what_affects_it`): eager folding runs off the
append path, and a fold with ``affects=None`` would wake it for every message body in
the log -- which is the cost the mode exists to avoid paying on a read.

And an eager fold ADVANCES with no reader
(:func:`test_an_emitted_entry_advances_an_eager_fold_with_no_reader`), which is the
whole claim: a dashboard reads the current value in O(1) because the value was already
folded when the entry landed, not because the read got faster.
