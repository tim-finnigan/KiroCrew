"""Contract tests for ``messaging/auto_title.py``.

Auto-titling was Slack-only, and dead on Slack's own default path:
``_maybe_auto_title_slack`` was called from the native loop and nowhere else,
while ``messaging.use_transport`` defaults True — so a default install titled
nothing and every surface fell back to a deterministic truncation.

These tests pin the hoisted core: the claim that makes a session titled exactly
once even with two channels racing, the two guards that stop a generated name
from replacing a name a person chose, and the tool-free turn.

Every test is written so that reverting the guard it names turns it red — see the
per-test notes on what to break.

    Implements the real ``update_metadata_if`` contract: the guard is evaluated
    against the record as it stands at write time, the return value says whether
    the merge was applied, and ``require_existing`` refuses a session with no
    file at all. *exists* stands for that file, which is a separate question from
    what the metadata dict holds -- in the real store an absent session and an
    untitled one both reach the guard as ``{}``.

    *becomes* models the record being REPLACED during the naming turn: the first
    status read (the caller's own, before the turn) sees the original, and
    everything after it sees the replacement. That is what a deletion plus a new
    message on the same thread does, because the session key is derived from the
    thread rather than from the record. An empty *becomes* means the record is
    GONE, which is a different state from a record that is merely stamp-less.

    *becomes_unreadable* models the first line being damaged during the turn: the
    real store answers ``({}, False)`` for that, without raising, and refuses the
    write. An unreadable record is evidence of neither presence nor absence.

    A default record carries a creation stamp, because a real one always does --
    the append path mints ``created_at`` when it creates the session file. "No
    record at all" is therefore spelled ``exists=False``, and a record written in
    an older shape is spelled by passing a dict without a stamp.
