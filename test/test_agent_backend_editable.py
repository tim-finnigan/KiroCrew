"""``agent.acp_backend`` is writable from the dashboard, and only to real backends.

The Settings > Agent Harness switch writes this field over
``PATCH /api/config/kirocrew``, so it has to be in ``_EDITABLE_CONFIG`` at all —
before this it was absent and every save came back "field not editable".

The selectable-backend set is a REGISTRY an edition extends at boot
(``register_selectable_backend``), which no import-time literal can see. A parity
check against a literal copy of the list cannot see that registry, so these tests
instead pin that each surface RESOLVES the set at request time from the one
owner, ``agent_sdk.backends``, rather than carrying its own answer.
