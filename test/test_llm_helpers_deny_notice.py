"""Every HOST deny in ``llm_helpers`` steers the in-band notice before it rejects.

A rejected permission reaches the model as kiro-cli's fixed "User denied tool
execution". The dashboard chat runner steers the real reason into the running
turn first; ``llm_helpers`` is the surface behind cron, Slack, workflow,
heartbeat and background one-liner turns, none of which has a dashboard slot,
and it must do the same.

Two halves, mirroring ``test_refusal_inband_notice.py``:

* a SOURCE-LEVEL guard that walks every ``reject_tool(`` in the module and fails
  when one is not preceded by the shared steer within a few lines -- except the
  one genuine USER rejection, which must stay bare because there kiro-cli's
  wording is the truth and "this was NOT a user action" would be a lie;
* BEHAVIOURAL tests, one per deny reason, that drive the real
  ``_resolve_permission`` with a provider double recording steer/reject ORDER.
  Order is the mechanism: the steer must be written while the permission request
  is still unanswered, because that is what proves the turn is in flight and
  gets the notice queued instead of dropped.

The steer is one more await on the ACP pipe before the reject, so the guard also
pins the audit-first rule ``test_deny_audit_first`` states for the chat runner:
the SEL row is written BEFORE the steer and the reject, or a backend that stops
reading stdin would cancel the coroutine at the turn deadline with the decision
acted on and never audited.
