"""Replayed history carries no image reference into a prompt.

A history row's picture belonged to an earlier turn, and a text vehicle cannot
carry bytes, so the reference is the only thing that would arrive. Both readings
of an arriving reference are wrong, and both are pinned below:

* the file is still readable -- ``build_prompt_blocks`` inlines it, so a picture
  Kiro Crew's compaction already dropped rides along at full byte cost on every
  cold start, and the markdown is mangled into ``![alt]([image: name])``;
* the file is absent -- no image block is emitted and the PATH sits in the prose,
  next to the assistant's own description of what the picture showed. That
  dangling reference is what makes a model narrate a screenshot it cannot see.

Kiro Crew's replay is the path an auto-compaction reaches. A failing in-place
``/compact`` sends ``CompactionCoordinator._recycle_held``, which pops the
session while leaving ``_suppress_replay`` alone -- ``reset(clear_conversation=
True)`` arms that flag, a recycle deliberately does not, because a recycle
preserves the conversation -- and the compact callback posts its success notice
either way. The next turn is therefore a cold start that re-injects the
transcript, and a persisted row keeps its markdown image reference by design:
the attachment store rewrites the destination into the transcript's
``.attachments/`` directory so the reference survives.

The three consumers that render persisted rows into prompt text all draw from
``_replay_rows`` / ``_recall_rows``, which is why the strip happens there.

The bare-path pass is narrower than the inliner's own ``_PATH_RE``, and each
narrowing is pinned: code spans and URL-embedded paths keep their text, because
rewriting either is corruption rather than scrubbing; and a span holding a space
or tab is replaced only when its last token is a path on its own or its shape
vouches for the whole span, so a sentence that merely mentions a directory and,
later, an image name keeps every word.
