"""The artifact library and the uploads directory ride a snapshot.

`config_dir()/artifacts` -- every report, log and generated file an agent or the
operator saved -- and `config_dir()/uploads` are component-table entries like memory and
skills, so a restored host gets them back. Without a table entry a restore comes back
without them and says nothing, which is the silent half of the failure: the command
reports success. `artifact_folders.json` is deliberately NOT one of them, so restored
artifacts arrive at the root of the library rather than in their folders.

The tests are grouped by the promise each one holds:

* the archive CARRIES both, and says so in its own manifest;
* replace and merge both put them back with the semantics the sibling trees have;
* an aliased entry -- a symlink, a hardlink, a swapped tree ROOT -- is refused here
  exactly as it is for `workspace` and `skills`, including at pre-restore backup
  time, where a skipped alias would be followed by an `rmtree` of the only copy;
  these two components inherit that from the shared staging path rather than
  adding a refusal of their own;
* an absent `uploads/` is the ordinary fresh-install shape, not a failure.
