"""Finalization contract of the shared channel turn pipeline.

``drive_turn`` owns the semaphore lifetime for every adopted channel, so a bug
in its ``finally`` is a bug in all of them at once. These tests pin the part
that is invisible on the happy path: what happens to ``release()`` when
finalization itself fails.
