"""Tests for the mid-turn steer branch in POST /api/chat (api_chat handler).

Exercises the steer path that reaches the running turn's live AcpClient via
``slot._acp_client``:
  * steered success -> broadcasts ``steer_push`` and returns ``{steered: True}``;
  * steer unavailable (no live client) -> safe fall-through to the queue;
  * steer raises -> caught, falls through to the queue (message never dropped).
