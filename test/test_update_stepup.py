"""Tests for the in-app wheel update step-up (arm + host-local approve).

The mechanism's whole point is what each half CANNOT do: the arm response
never carries the nonce (a dashboard bearer must not be able to approve), and
an approve without the exact armed nonce is refused. Both halves are pinned
here, plus TTL expiry, single-use consumption, and the endpoint refusals.
