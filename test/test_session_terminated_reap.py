"""Tests for reaping the runtime of a session whose owning slot is gone.

Every live session carries its own MCP server processes, so the live process
count on a host is the number of sessions times the servers each one spawns. A
session that is finished but still in the map keeps paying that cost, which on a
4 vCPU / 16 GB host is enough to saturate it.

The idle sweep expires such a session on two axes. The clock is one. The other
is that the session's owning dashboard slot is gone, and the authority for that
is ``active_dashboard_slots``, published by ``_sync_dashboard_slots``, which
carries the *effective* key of every open slot: a ``dashboard:`` key, a
channel-born slot's channel key, or a linked slot's ``linked_session_key`` such
as ``taskrunner:<id>:chat:<tok>`` or ``cron:<job>``. Without the second axis a
session of any non-``dashboard:`` shape waits out the full timeout, default 60
minutes, holding its runtime and its MCP children.

The reap may never touch a session that is live or resumable, which is why
absence from the live set is not on its own sufficient: it is equally true of a
cron fire, a task step or a hook that is running right now and never had a tab.
A key must have appeared in a published live set before its later absence means
anything. The remaining hazards are pinned below: a slot that reopens between
the scan and the reset, sub-agent work that outlives its parent's turn, and a
probe that cannot answer.
