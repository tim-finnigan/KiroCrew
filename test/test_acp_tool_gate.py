"""The tool gate reports routing honestly and refuses what it enforces.

Two axes that must not be conflated, and each test names which one it is on:

* **Truth** -- what :func:`routing_verdict` SAYS about a harness. Every harness
  gets an honest verdict, including the ones this core does not enforce.
* **Enforcement** -- whether a non-ROUTED verdict REFUSES. Scoped to the
  mechanisms this core implements end to end: ``SESSION_CONFIG``, which checks the
  advertised option, and ``VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS``, which reads back the setting
  it wrote.

Collapsing them is the failure this file exists to prevent: upgrading an
unenforced harness to ``ROUTED`` so it stops refusing would make the picker and
the doctor row assert a guarantee nothing performs.

Every test is revert-verified: with the corresponding guard removed they fail.

# READ-GATE floor, and the floor covers a Crew runtime artifact to keep the AGENT'S
# FILE TOOLS out of it, not to keep the CHILD out. Handed to a sandbox as a deny
# list, the same entry hid the directory the pi child had to exec its gate launcher
# out of -- the child saw an empty dir and every pi session was refused with exit
# 126. The audit that followed found the same collision on every ENFORCED harness,
# over every further leaf ``sandbox`` itself declares the child must reach. No count is
# written down here: the set is derived, a literal would be one more thing to drift,
# and ``test_the_declared_child_reachable_set_is_not_empty`` is what keeps it honest.
#
# So this is a per-BACKEND sweep over the whole roster, not a pi regression test: a
# new harness inherits the mask by declaring an enforced routing, and inherits the
# collision with it unless something fails here first.

# consent record holds no secret and its in-sandbox reader needs it. A live
# credential is exactly what this mask exists to keep from a harness that
# self-approves its own passive reads, and the fact that the first-class path is
# looser (``AGENTS.md`` carries ``sel_hmac.key`` as a VISIBLE residual with no OS
# fence) is not a licence to widen that residual to every enforced harness.
#
# So these five stay masked, and the features whose in-sandbox readers need them stay
# broken under an enforced harness until those readers move behind the gateway. They
# are broken TODAY, so withholding them is not a regression -- excluding them would
# have been a new exposure.
