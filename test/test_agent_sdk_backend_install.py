"""The ACP backend install probe: what the dashboard is told about this machine.

The probe exists because ``selectable`` is a build/policy fact and cannot say
whether the harness would actually start. Four properties carry that, and each
is a way the surface has a specific way of lying to an operator:

1. The probe answers through the SPAWN's resolvers. Every case here monkeypatches
   ``kiro_crew.acp.client``'s own resolvers, so a probe that grew a private PATH
   search would stop responding to these tests -- which is the point: a second
   search agrees with the spawn only by coincidence.
2. ``kas`` tracks ``kiro`` exactly, because KAS is served by kiro-cli's ACP relay
   and has no binary of its own. A drifting kas verdict would report a harness
   absent (or present) on the strength of a binary nobody looks for.
3. A resolver that RAISES yields ``unknown``, never ``missing``. Collapsing the
   two tells someone to run a global npm install for something they may already
   have.
4. Claude names WHICH component is absent. The adapter and the Claude CLI have
   different remedies, so a bare "missing" leaves the operator reinstalling the
   half they already have.

Plus the cache (the dashboard polls this and the Claude probe spawns mise) and
the endpoint's owner gate.
