"""The deprecated ``kirocrew-ledger-conductor`` alias spec.

The work-ledger flow is ``kirocrew-conductor`` now, and this name is kept for one
release because it is a public, user-facing string: it is what a running session
records as its agent, what a seed prompt names for a second-level conductor, and
what an operator typed into a cron. So one property carries this whole file:
**the alias emits the SAME spec, differing in ``name`` and ``description`` and in
nothing else.** An alias that emitted a different spec would silently change what
an in-flight session can do, which is the one failure the alias exists to prevent.

Everything the spec itself has to be — no file-writing tool, no whole-server
auto-approve, grants filtered through the governance ceiling, the KAS block
derived from the FILTERED list, the work mount on all four surfaces — is asserted
once in ``test_conductor_agent.py``, against the spec both installers share. It is
not re-asserted here: the identity test below is what carries it across.

The ceiling stub is the same shape as the sibling installer tests': the default is
an ungoverned host, and the governed case gets its own test.
