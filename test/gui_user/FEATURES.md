# GUI user-test feature inventory

The backlog for `.github/workflows/gui-user-test.yml`: every user-visible feature of the
dashboard, written as the scenario the lane would drive, so scenario batches can be cut
by feature and by priority instead of by whoever remembered a page. This file is RENDERED
from `features.json` by `features_catalog.py` -- edit the JSON, then run
`python test/gui_user/features_catalog.py --write`; `test_features_catalog.py` fails when
the two disagree. Generated from `docs/feature-map/README.md`, `website/src/pages/**`,
`website/src/surfaces/builtins.tsx`, the settings registry, the builtin apps and
`docs/system-specs/modules/**` at commit `2f71d47e6c06`, then deduped by route + flow. It is an
inventory, not a contract: a row says what a person can do and where, the scenario YAML
under `scenarios/` says how the lane checks it.

## How to read a row

- **Priority**: P0 = newly merged UI or a core daily path, first scenario batch; P1 = other
  smoke-tier flows; P2 = nightly-tier flows; P3 = not generated (see *Not generated*).
- **Runnable**: `smoke` = core path in about five model actions (PR + nightly); `nightly` =
  runs on the lane's target (Xvfb + Chromium, fake ACP backend, no login, no network);
  `native-only` = needs the Electron shell; `needs-secret` = needs a real external account
  or credential; `excluded` = not observable through pixels or would take the target down.
- **Seed**: the `KIROCREW_HOME` fixture the target boots from (`kirocrew gateway --seed`).
- **Steps**: estimated model actions; the scenario's `max_steps` should sit a little above.

Features the lane cannot drive on its target. Listed so the gap is a decision, not an omission.

| Tier | Id | Feature | Title | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| native-only | `chat-browser-panel` | browser-panel | Browser panel | The panel is owned by the Electron native Chromium view and Annotate is IPC-only. Web-only degradation is limited to asserting the tab and its 'use playwright-cli' guidance / empty state render, which browser-panel-open… |
| native-only | `app-crew-companion-reminders` | apps | Crew Companion: set break interval and add a reminder | Requires the Electron desktop app and its companion process; the target has no Electron. Degradable to web-only only for the offline landing state and cached Memories. |
| native-only | `app-mochi-dashboard` | apps | Mochi: enable the desktop pet and view activity, watchlist, and plan | Pet window, click-through transparency, and panel windows need Electron, which the target lacks; the dashboard data page alone is degradable to web-only. |
| native-only | `settings-channels-imessage-configure` | channels | Configure iMessage channel (enable, allowed handles, service, DB path) | Requires the macOS Messages database; form rendering is degradable to web-only but the channel cannot start on Linux. |
| native-only | `standalone-crash-report-notice` | notifications | Crash report notice | Driven by Electron IPC (crash-reports:get/reveal) and the OS file manager; the target has no Electron shell, so the banner never appears and there is no web-only degradation. |
| native-only | `computer-use-live-view-pip` | computer-use | Live view PiP mirrors screenshots the agent already read | Depends on a macOS/Windows accessibility capture and a model that invokes computer_get_state; neither exists on the Linux fake-ACP target. |
| native-only | `settings-computer-use-enable-toggle` | computer-use | Enable computer use and tune screenshot/tree options | Persistence is web-testable (degradable) but the capability only functions with the desktop accessibility layer. |
| native-only | `popout-chat` | popout | Popout chat window | Opening an OS window is Electron behaviour, so native-only; degradable to a web-only check by loading /popout/chat/<slug> directly and asserting the chrome-less frame. Two popout records merged. |
| native-only | `popout-terminal-window` | popout | Pop the terminal out and re-dock it | Requires a second window and a PTY; Electron-first, so native-only. Degradable: load /popout/terminal directly and assert the frame. Moved the feature-map popout-terminal record from the chat bucket (docked terminal is … |
| native-only | `settings-chat-toggle-prevent-sleep` | settings | Toggle Prevent sleep while running | Toggle persistence is web-testable (degradable), but the actual sleep-inhibit effect needs Electron. |
| native-only | `settings-developer-run-local-gateway-toggle` | settings | Toggle Run a local gateway | Desktop-app-only section; not degradable to web because it is hidden without Electron. |
| native-only | `settings-notifications-background-chat-finished` | settings | Toggle Notify when a background chat finishes | Toggle persistence is web-testable (degradable), but OS notification delivery needs Electron and window focus state. |
| needs-secret | `chat-mcp-oauth-banner-sign-in` | chat | Complete MCP OAuth from the chat banner | Requires a real OAuth provider account. |
| needs-secret | `standalone-source-provider-review` | chat | Source-provider review | Fetching PR state requires a real source-provider token. |
| needs-secret | `sidebar-connect-your-phone-modal` | sidebar | Open the Connect your phone dialog | Kept needs-secret: the row only appears when /api/mobile-connect returns a renderable method, and every real method (tunnel/tailnet) needs an external account the no-network target lacks. Rendering the modal against a s… |
| needs-secret | `connections-services-gallery-oauth` | connections | Connect a third-party service from the Services gallery | Completing OAuth needs a real provider account; card rendering alone is nightly-testable. |
| needs-secret | `wakatime-activity-and-export` | memory | WakaTime coding activity and export | Stats come from the WakaTime API with a personal key; the empty-state alone is nightly-renderable. |
| needs-secret | `artifacts-deploy` | artifacts | Deploy | The deploy action needs an external AWS account and network, which the target has neither of. Only the config/scan page renders offline — that read-only render could be split out as a nightly check later. |
| needs-secret | `artifacts-publishing` | artifacts | Publishing | Publishing targets a real external provider; the empty-provider share menu is the only offline-renderable part. |
| needs-secret | `artifacts-remote` | artifacts | Remote artifacts | Browsing requires a live provider account and network; no fixture stands in for it. |
| needs-secret | `app-auto-improvement-run` | apps | Auto-Improvement: connect a GitHub repo, calibrate ruler, view findings | Primary flow depends on an authenticated gh CLI and a real GitHub repo to clone, measure, and draft PRs against; the empty setup panel alone could be checked nightly but is not the primary flow. |
| needs-secret | `app-aws-control-drive` | apps | AWS Control: view account health and browse the S3 cloud drive | Every meaningful surface (account health, drive listing, share links) requires live AWS credentials and an S3 bucket the user owns; the target has no network and no credentials. |
| needs-secret | `app-code-review-sage-review-pr` | apps | Code Review Sage: add a repo and review a pull request | Repository discovery, PR listing, and draft review staging all go through the authenticated gh CLI against GitHub. |
| needs-secret | `app-issue-radar-connect-triage` | apps | Issue Radar: connect a repository and triage issues | Repository connection, issue caching, and every write go through authenticated provider CLIs; only the welcome carousel is reachable without them. |
| needs-secret | `app-meetings-live-transcribe` | apps | Meetings: start a meeting and capture live transcript with notes | The primary flow needs a working STT backend (an optional heavy install the no-network target cannot fetch) and a calendar/audio source; only the empty meeting list and settings views render from fixtures, and that is n… |
| needs-secret | `app-ops-mission-control-board` | apps | Ops Mission Control: configure a provider and work an incident on the board | Primary flow needs a real monitoring provider credential; a signed generic webhook could degrade this to nightly but the board is empty without a configured provider. |
| needs-secret | `app-pptx-maker-studio` | apps | PPTX Maker: open the studio, browse the library, and start a deck chat | The primary flow (start a deck chat, watch preview) requires the engine download and MCP tools that need network, which the target does not have; the Decks/Library/Settings views render headless but are not the primary … |
| needs-secret | `chat-channel-mirroring` | channels | Channel mirroring | Linking requires a real messaging-provider token to list channel targets; the menu shell alone renders without one. |
| needs-secret | `settings-channel-connect-slack` | channels | Connect Slack in the Slack channel panel | Requires real bot tokens; form rendering is nightly-testable. |
| needs-secret | `settings-channels-feishu-wecom-configure` | channels | Configure Feishu / WeCom channels | Requires real platform app credentials to verify a connection. |
| needs-secret | `settings-channels-teams-configure` | channels | Configure Microsoft Teams channel (App ID, password, tenant, allowed users) | Requires real Azure Bot credentials to reach a connected state. |
| needs-secret | `settings-channels-webex-configure` | channels | Configure Webex channel (token, allowed emails, group spaces, thread reply) | Connection verification requires a real Webex bot token; form is renderable on nightly. |
| needs-secret | `settings-channels-weixin-configure` | channels | Configure WeChat (Weixin) channel | Connecting requires a real WeChat login/QR; UI-only form is nightly-degradable. |
| needs-secret | `settings-channels-whatsapp-configure` | channels | Configure WhatsApp channel (enable, who can message, how the agent joins in) | Real account pairing required for connection; conditional form rendering could be nightly. |
| needs-secret | `stt-dictation-aws-transcribe` | voice | Dictate through AWS Transcribe after granting consent | Billed AWS service with real credentials and network; also needs a microphone, which the target lacks. |
| needs-secret | `voice-polly-synthesis-with-aws-consent` | voice | Select Amazon Polly and pass the AWS consent gate before hearing a reply | A paid AWS service reached with real credentials over the network; the target has neither. |
| needs-secret | `shell-instances-tab-bar-switching` | instances | Switch between Local and remote crew panes | Needs a reachable remote instance over a tunnel. |
| needs-secret | `settings-instances-remote-crew` | remote-instances | Add a remote crew and switch panes via the header tab strip | Connecting needs a real peer and tunnel credentials; the form and empty tab strip are nightly-testable. |
| needs-secret | `themes-install-pack-from-github` | themes | Install a theme pack from a github.com URL | Needs outbound network to github.com (and a sandbox backend), unavailable on the target. |
| excluded | `chat-mcp-app-inline-render` | chat | An MCP App renders inline in chat as a sandboxed iframe with a live bridge | Not reachable on the fake backend/no-network target. |
| excluded | `chat-workflow-launch-and-completion-cards` | chat | workflow_run shows a launch card and later a completion card in chat | Depends on real MCP tool execution by a model, absent on the fake ACP target. |
| excluded | `knowledge-fetch-url-source` | knowledge | Add a URL source that is fetched and ingested | No external account is involved, the blocker is outbound network, which the target does not have, so the fetch fails by construction and the flow is unobservable here. |
| excluded | `artifacts-widget-auto-registration-from-chat` | artifacts | A chat-rendered mcwidget is auto-registered as an artifact | Not reachable on the fake backend; requires a model that emits widget markup. |
| excluded | `browser-panel-load-dev-server-preview` | browser-panel | Load a locally served dev-server URL into the Browser tab iframe | The target's managed browser policy (URLBlocklist * with only the gateway origin allowed) makes any dev-server iframe fail by construction, so the behaviour cannot be observed on this harness; it is web-capable elsewher… |
| excluded | `app-papyrus-create-compile` | apps | Papyrus: create a paper, edit LaTeX, and compile to PDF | Excluded: compiling to PDF needs a TeX toolchain the lane's runner image does not install, so the asserted end state is unreachable; a create-and-edit-only scenario without compile could be nightly. Paper creation and e… |
| excluded | `apps-migration` | apps | App migration | Excluded until a fixture ships an orphaned app: no tests_fixtures seed carries one, so the migration page (/apps/migrate/<name>) is unreachable on the target. Page renders from fixture state and mutates only fixture sta… |
| excluded | `schedule-agent-chat-egress` | api | Agent chat egress | No UI and requires a live provider; not pixel-testable. |
| excluded | `schedule-session-control` | api | Session control | No UI; side effects show up as ordinary sessions covered elsewhere. |
| excluded | `schedule-session-ledger` | api | Session ledger | No UI surface; not pixel-testable. |
| excluded | `schedule-work-ledger` | api | Work ledger | No UI surface today; not pixel-testable. |
| excluded | `standalone-openai-compatible-api` | api | OpenAI-compatible API | HTTP-only surface with no dashboard pixels. |
| excluded | `chat-voice-reply-and-dictation` | voice | Voice reply and dictation | The Electron shell would not add a microphone, an audio sink or a recogniser model to the Xvfb host, so no native lane on this target could observe the behaviour either. The mic button and Read-aloud menu entry renderin… |
| excluded | `notifications-desktop-alert-toast-opt-in` | notifications | Opt into Desktop alerts and receive an OS toast when a background session finishes | The outcome is an OS-level toast outside the browser viewport and gated on a permission prompt; not pixel-testable on Xvfb. The toggle itself is covered by settings-notifications. |
| excluded | `notifications-turn-complete-chime-audio` | notifications | Hear the chime when a turn completes | Audio output is not pixel-testable and leaves no visible record; Xvfb has no audio sink. The chime preset control itself is asserted in settings-notifications. |
| excluded | `chat-remote-bound-session` | remote-instances | Remote-bound session | This is not a missing credential but a missing second live Kiro Crew instance plus a network tunnel, which the Xvfb+fake-ACP, no-network target cannot provide. Only the flag-gated menu entry is renderable (cover that in… |
| excluded | `standalone-cloud-launch` | remote-instances | Cloud launch | Kept excluded rather than needs-secret: beyond real AWS credentials it provisions billable infrastructure and exposes Stop/Delete-by-tag lifecycle, so it must not run even with secrets. Only the lane selector and IAM po… |
| excluded | `kas-auth-chat-error-row-sign-in-link` | auth | An auth-required turn renders a 'Sign in to Kiro' error row deep-linking to the card | Excluded: the fake ACP backend cannot emit the AcpAuthRequired vocabulary (only [[ERROR]]), so the row and its deep link are unreachable on the target. Closing that harness gap (an auth-required sentinel) is the prerequ… |
| excluded | `settings-about-check-for-updates` | settings | Check for updates and install | Network-dependent and restarts the application; not pixel-testable. |
| excluded | `settings-browser-install-cli` | settings | Install playwright-cli and a browser engine from Settings | Network download and host mutation; not pixel-testable deterministically. |
| excluded | `settings-ui-prefs-backup` | settings | UI preference host backup | Cross-cutting mechanism with no UI of its own; verified through the settings rows it backs, not pixels. |
| excluded | `settings-voice-stt-model-download` | settings | Download a local STT model | Requires large external download and disk writes; not suitable for pixel tests. |
