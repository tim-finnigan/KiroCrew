"""A tool gate that raises refuses the call and says why.

The gate parses untrusted command text. When a parser raised on input nobody
anticipated (a NUL byte once made the inline-payload lexer raise
``SystemError``), the exception escaped ``HookManager.on_tool_call`` and each
caller handled it its own way; on the dashboard the refused call was reported
as aborted by the user. These tests pin the one shared outcome: a security
deny whose reason names the crash.
