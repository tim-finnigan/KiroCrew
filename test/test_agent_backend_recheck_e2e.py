"""``POST /api/acp-backends/recheck`` over HTTP, with a real binary appearing on disk.

The unit tests in ``test_agent_sdk_backend_install.py`` stub the resolvers, which is
right for pinning the contract and wrong for answering "does the whole path work".
This file answers that: the real route table is mounted on an in-process aiohttp
server and driven over HTTP, so the router, the owner gate, the JSON body, the install
probe, the resolution ladder and the spawn path's own cache all take part.

The install is REAL -- an executable file that does not exist at the first probe and
does exist at the second. That is what makes the sequence evidence rather than a
restatement of the stubs: the first verdict is a miss because the file is absent.

What this does NOT cover: a human pressing the button in a browser against a live
gateway, because starting a listening gateway is refused by the sandbox this was written
in. That is a property of one environment rather than of this code, so it is stated in
the pull request and deliberately NOT pinned here -- an assertion about the host running
the suite would either never fail or fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the
subject.
