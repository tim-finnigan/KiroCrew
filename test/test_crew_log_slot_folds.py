"""The slot-level crew-log folds on the projection kernel.

A slot's fold runs over the CONCATENATION of every unit it ran under, and a crew
log's ``seq`` restarts at 1 in each unit file -- so the kernel, which holds one
watermark per cell and drops an event at or below it, is handed an ORDINAL instead:
the entry's own seq plus the heights of the units before it.

The load-bearing test here is :func:`test_a_warm_read_equals_a_cold_fold`, which is
what makes the whole path safe to keep warm: whatever the incremental route does, the
value it serves is the one a fold from empty over the same units reaches. The rest pin
the cases that must NOT be continued -- a longer unit list, a recreated newest unit, an
older unit that grew -- because each of those is a wrong answer rather than a slow one.
