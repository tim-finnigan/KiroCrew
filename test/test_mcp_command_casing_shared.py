"""The Windows command-casing repair is shared by every resolver, not one.

``shutil.which`` spells the extension it appends exactly as ``PATHEXT`` spells
it, so a bare ``demo-mcp`` resolves to ``demo-mcp.EXE`` while the file on disk is
``demo-mcp.exe``. A launcher that dispatches on its own ``argv[0]`` basename
case-sensitively refuses to run under the synthesized spelling.

The repair lives in ``kiro_crew.env`` beside ``mcp_search_path`` and is applied
by all three consumers of a ``which`` result: the agent-config resolver (whose
result is PERSISTED as the spec's absolute ``command``), the dashboard probe, and
gatewayd's rewriter. The rewriter's own coverage lives in
``test_mcp_gateway_command_casing.py``; these tests pin the helper and the two
other call sites.

Windows is forced per call, not per test: forcing ``IS_WINDOWS`` across a whole
rebuild or probe would switch every other platform branch too, so the wrapper
below flips it only while the helper itself runs.
