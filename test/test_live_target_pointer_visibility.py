"""The live-target pointer's spawn refusal has to reach a HUMAN, not just the log.

``sandbox._materialize_live_target_mask_target`` is fail-closed on every Linux spawn: a
symlink, a non-regular file, or a second hard link on ``live_target.json`` means a bind
mask over that name would leave another writable path to the bytes the gateway
``execve``s into, so the launcher refuses rather than run an agent with the hole open.
That refusal is right. Its VISIBILITY was not:

* the operator's only notice was a ``logger.warning`` in the gateway log plus agents that
  stopped starting -- and the shapes that trigger it are ordinary operation for something
  else on the host (``cp -al``, rsnapshot, a dotfile manager keeping the pointer as a
  link), so nobody did anything wrong and nobody has a reason to read that log;
* on the CLI the refusal is not in the ``AcpError`` hierarchy, so ``_stream_and_print``'s
  handler never saw it and it escaped as a stack trace that reads as a Kiro Crew crash;
* nothing named the condition BEFORE a spawn tried and failed.

So this file pins three surfaces and the one property that keeps them honest: they all
say the SAME sentence, because they all read it from the same formatter. A paraphrase in
any one of them is a second diagnosis of one file, and the drift guard here fails on it.
