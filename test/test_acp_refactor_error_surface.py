"""Characterization of the ACP error surface: formatted text, raised type, and tags.

Pins, byte for byte, what ``_format_acp_error`` / ``_raise_acp_error`` produce for
each provider-failure branch, plus the free-text classifiers that share their
vocabulary (``classify_provider_error``, ``is_auth_failure_output``, the
registration-throttle and sandbox-init detectors) and the compaction-failure
readers. Every expected value is a literal read off the current code, never one
computed with the function under test.

The code is reached only through the ``kiro_crew.acp.client`` facade, so these
tests hold unchanged before and after the definitions move to their owner module.
