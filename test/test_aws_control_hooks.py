"""Coverage for the aws_control nightly backup lifecycle hooks.

``test_aws_control_app.py::TestRound22Hardening`` already pins the two
end-of-loop SEL cases (full success emits ``invoked``+``succeeded``; a raising
backup is audited ``failed``) by patching ``hooks._audit`` wholesale. Those
leave the interesting parts of the module untested: every EARLY-RETURN guard in
``_run_once`` that makes the loop fail closed, the ``_audit`` body itself
(including its best-effort swallow), the ``_loop`` supervisor's error
swallowing, and ``on_startup`` / ``on_shutdown`` idempotence. This file covers
exactly those, and never leaves a real background task running past a test.
