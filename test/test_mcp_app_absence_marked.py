"""A transcript row records the MCP App this tool call produced.

The render payload is live-only by design: it goes out on the owner-only
WebSocket, carries the app's callback capability, and its spool record expires.
A stored transcript holds nothing that can rebuild the frame, so a reader can
have the turn's prose describing an artifact they cannot see. The row's durable
flag is what lets the dashboard say the app exists.

These drive the real ``dashboard.chat_runner._run_chat`` turn loop with a fake
ACP client, so what they measure is the flag a REPLAY reads off disk rather
than a reimplementation of the write. The harness mirrors
``test_acp_tool_identity.TestChatRunnerDirectiveSeam``.
