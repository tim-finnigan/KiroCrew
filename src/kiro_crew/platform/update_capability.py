"""The one derivation of install shape → update capability.

Whether an update *can* be applied by the running process is a property of how
this copy was installed. Whether it *should* be applied without asking is a
property of channel and policy. Conflating the two is what makes an update UI
render impossible actions: a shape question (``isDesktop``) gets asked to answer
a consent question.

Every caller — the dashboard check endpoint, the apply endpoint, the CLI update
command — reads its answer from :func:`derive_capability` instead of probing the
environment itself, so the derivation cannot drift between them.

``mode`` describes the designed consent posture for a shape, not the behavior of
the legacy ``auto_update`` config key. What that key actually does on this
install is :func:`auto_update_effect`, the one derivation both the gateway's
unattended update loop and the dashboard status read.

Two fields specified for this contract are deliberately absent: ``state`` and
``progress`` describe an apply/drain lifecycle that does not exist yet, and
serving them as constants would advertise transitions a consumer could poll for
forever.

    knows there is none.

    the installer route's own gates -- and returns ``None`` for a checkout,
