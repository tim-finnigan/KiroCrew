"""Eager folding: an EAGER fold is advanced when its entry lands, not when it is read.

TWO FAMILIES, ONE WORKER. A SLOT-keyed fold joins every unit a slot ran under; a
SESSION-keyed fold reads one unit's own file. Each has its own warm memo in
:mod:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection` and this worker drives both from the same wake:
the wake names the unit, a slot fold is advanced for the slot that unit's entry belongs
to, and the unit's session folds are advanced for the unit itself
(:func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.fold_session_warm`).

WHY THIS EXISTS. A slot-keyed fold is answered by walking every line of every unit the
slot ran under, because the fold interprets one entry type and the file is mostly
message bodies (:func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.fold_slot_warm` says this at
length). The warm memo removed the repeat of that walk, but never the first one, and a
dashboard reading the work board on a timer pays it on every cold cell. The value it
wants is a function of entries this process has just written, so it can be folded then
-- and the read becomes a memo lookup.

WHAT IS ON THE APPEND PATH. One :meth:`queue.Queue.put_nowait`. Not the slot lookup,
not the fold, not the frame: those are the worker's, because each of them reads a file
or builds a value and the thread that just committed an entry is either the event loop
or the one writer thread every session's appends are serialized through. A full queue
DROPS and counts (:func:`eager_dropped`) rather than waiting, for the reason the
emitter gives about its own buffer: a slow consumer must cost currency, never turn
latency. Dropping is safe because the fold is not the record -- the log is -- so a
dropped wake leaves the memo behind the file and the next READ carries it forward,
which is exactly the lazy behaviour that was there before.

WHAT THE WORKER RUNS. :func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.read_slot_projection` for a
slot fold and :func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.fold_session_warm` for a session's,
the same calls the dashboard routes make. Not a second folding path: the rules a slot fold
has to enforce about continuing a cell -- a changed unit list, a recreated unit, an
earlier unit that grew, a rewritten prefix -- are stated once over there, and a rule
missing from a copy here would be a wrong record rather than a slow one. It also
resolves the unit list through the fold's OWNER, which is what makes the value the
eager path stores equal to the one a reader would have folded.

WHAT IT PUBLISHES, AND WHAT MADE THAT POSSIBLE. An advanced fold is published on
:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.bus` as a ``FoldAdvanced(scope, key, fold, revision, value,
seq)``, one per coalesced batch per fold it moved. Through a bus and not to a named consumer, because this value has
several consumers coming and this module must know about none of them; the dashboard's WS
exporter subscribes where the dashboard state exists.

IT ALSO PUSHES A DEADLINE: a conductor's armed work-ledger loop is pulled forward when a
worker bound to it commits a ``work/recorded`` entry (:func:`_push_conductor_wakes`). That
carries no value and no frame, so the revision contract below does not apply to it -- the
conductor's own gate then reads the ledger itself, under its own identity, exactly as on a
scheduled tick. It rides this drain rather than the append because the lookup is a file
read and the fire crosses onto the event loop, neither of which may sit on a worker's own
``work_report``.

The first version of this module deliberately published NOTHING, and the obstacle was real:
a slot fold's ``last_seq`` is the NEWEST unit's own seq by contract, and conductor units are
folded before worker units -- so a conductor-side change on a board with any worker bound
leaves that number unmoved, and any client rule that ordered frames by it would discard the
changed value. What was missing was a monotonic per-(slot, fold) revision that the read path
and the event share. :func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.fold_slot_warm_revised` is that
contract: the process that folds mints the number, it is never read off a file, and a cell
carried forward unchanged keeps it -- so the consumer rule is "keep the highest revision per
(slot, fold), discard anything lower" and an idle board produces no event at all.

A DROPPED PUBLISH IS STILL SAFE, which is the property the dropped WAKE already had and the
one this must not spend. A subscriber that raises, a full socket, a client that reconnects:
each leaves the memo ahead of the consumer, and the next lazy read serves the current value.
The publish is currency, never the record.

WHAT IT IS NOT. Durable for a slot. A session fold has its savepoint beside the unit's
file and the warm memo brings it forward; a slot memo lives in this process, so a
restart folds a slot cold. A savepoint for a SLOT fold would be a store of its own, keyed by slot rather than by
unit, with its own admission rules about the unit vector it was folded over. That is
not this module's, and :func:`~kiro_crew.session_ledger._fold_checkpoint` already says
so about the same cell.

    write leaves entries owed forever, so a required drain would fail exactly those tests
    for doing their job.

    Stopping second leaves no daemon running.

    And the fence closes what draining cannot. A late append lands on the writer thread
    after this returns, calls :func:`note_commit`, and :func:`_ensure_worker` would answer
    it by clearing the stop flag and starting a replacement daemon -- which resolves the
    data home when it folds, by then whatever the environment names. So this sets a latch
    and :func:`note_commit` drops wakes while it holds: between one caller's teardown and
