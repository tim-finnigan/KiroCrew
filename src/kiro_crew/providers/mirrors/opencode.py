"""opencode's agent-config mirror (``opencode acp``).

The wire face only, and it exists because the reason opencode had no projection
was WRONG. The previous declaration read the harness's ``initialize`` result --
``mcpCapabilities: {"http": true, "sse": true}`` -- as evidence that the
``session/new`` ``mcpServers`` array could not carry a stdio server. It carries
them fine. ACP's own ``McpCapabilities`` schema has exactly two boolean fields,
``http`` and ``sse``, and no ``stdio`` field at all, so a conforming agent CANNOT
advertise stdio and ``{"http": true, "sse": true}`` is what full support looks
like. The absence proved nothing, and reading it as a refusal left every opencode
session with none of Crew's own tools -- no ``spawn_run``, no ``cron_add``, no
``send_message`` -- on a harness that is selectable, working in every visible
respect.

Measured against opencode 1.18.30 rather than re-inferred
(``docs/request-for-change/rfc-agent-config-mirror.md``, and the ratchet in
``test/test_opencode_session_mcp.py``):

* The element ``acp/session_mcp.py::acp_server_element`` already emits --
  ``{"name", "command", "args", "env": [{"name","value"}], "type": "stdio"}`` --
  is ACCEPTED, the child is spawned, its tools are listed and the element's ``env``
  reaches it. Dropping the ``type`` key gives a byte-identical result.
* ``type: "stdio"`` is TOLERATED AND DISCARDED, not honoured -- and this
  projection DROPS IT anyway rather than relying on that. The adapter's ACP union
  is ``http`` and ``sse`` as tagged members plus an untagged stdio member, and zod
  strips unknown keys, so the tag fails the two tagged members and matches the
  untagged one, which has no ``type`` field. But the mapping function then
  discriminates on the mere PRESENCE of ``type``, so a tag that SURVIVED would take
  the element down the remote branch and throw on its ``headers``. Sending the tag
  therefore makes every session start depend on one third-party implementation
  detail -- a schema switched to passthrough or strict -- and on this harness the
  penalty is not one missing server but ``-32602`` for the whole ``session/new``.
  Removing it costs nothing (measured byte-identical with and without) and removes
  the dependence, so :func:`opencode_elements` removes it.
* ``env`` and ``args`` are REQUIRED arrays, and a malformed element fails the
  WHOLE ``session/new`` with ``-32602`` -- not just that server. That is why
  ``acp_server_element``'s skip-and-log discipline is load-bearing here rather than
  merely tidy, and it is the opposite of codex, where a malformed stdio element is
  dropped and the request succeeds.
* ``http`` and ``sse`` elements are BOTH accepted, so this backend needs no
  analogue of codex's :func:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.codex.drop_unadvertised_transports`.
  One caveat worth stating rather than discovering: the adapter maps ``sse`` onto
  its own ``remote`` kind, which is streamable HTTP, and it has no SSE-specific
  path -- so an SSE-only server mounted here is spoken to over the wrong shape.
  That is the harness's mapping, not something a projection can correct.
* The MCP child INHERITS the ambient environment (133 variables in the probe); it
  is not ``env_clear()``ed the way codex's is. The element ``env`` is still the
  right carrier for ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``, but for a different reason -- it is
  what makes the value THIS session's rather than the gateway's.

Crew writes no opencode config file of its own beyond the permission routing
(``AcpClient._opencode_routing_config`` seeds ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` with the
one setting ``tool_gate`` demands), and the MCP servers deliberately do NOT travel
there. That channel works, but ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` MERGES with the project
and user config rather than replacing them, and declaring the same server in both
the config block and the array DOUBLE-MOUNTS it: both children spawn, because the
array does not go through config resolution at all. So the array is the one
channel, and this module is the whole of it.

    **The identity env goes on Crew's OWN CONTROL PLANE and nowhere else.**
    ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` is the credential Crew's internal API authenticates a
    session-directive claim with, so it may ride only an element Crew itself
    derived. ``kirocrew-core`` and ``kirocrew-cron`` are exactly that: the shared
    translation REPLACES them from ``managed_mcp_spec_entry``, so their command,
    args and env are Crew's own by construction and no part of the hand-editable
    spec reaches the child. Everything else in the array gets NO Crew identity,
    because an element the spec describes is one whose command, args and env the
    spec chose -- handing it this session's credential would let a hand-edited line
    drive the session it was mounted into.

    The carriage is needed for a DIFFERENT reason than codex's, and the difference
    is worth keeping straight because it decides what happens if the rule is
    dropped. codex-rs ``env_clear()``s its stdio children, so without the element
    ``env`` codex's control plane has no session key at all. opencode's children
    inherit the ambient environment, so a gateway-level ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``
    would reach them -- and it would be the WRONG one, the gateway's rather than
    this session's. Dropping the rule here therefore mis-scopes rather than
    empties, which is the harder failure to notice.

    **The stdio ``type`` tag is REMOVED, and that is not tidiness.** The adapter
    tolerates it only because zod strips unknown keys before its union matches the
    untagged stdio member -- and its ACP-to-native mapping then branches on whether
    ``type`` is PRESENT, so a tag that survived would be routed as a remote server
    and throw on its absent ``headers``. Keeping it would make every opencode
    session start depend on that stripping behaviour, and the penalty here is the
    whole ``session/new`` failing with ``-32602`` rather than one server going
    missing. Measured byte-identical with and without
    (``test_real_opencode_acp_accepts_the_crew_stdio_element`` drives both shapes),
    so the safe form is free. Only the stdio tag goes: ``http`` and ``sse`` elements
    need theirs, because for them the tag is what the adapter's union matches on.

    **No name folding, and that is a measured absence rather than an omission.**
    codex registers a client element under
    ``name.replace(whitespace, "_")``, so its mirror has to reproduce the fold or
    its own session report names a server that does not exist. opencode registers
    the name as given (``mcp.add({directory, name, config})``); the sanitising it
    does do is on the TOOL id it shows the model
    (``sanitize(server) + "_" + sanitize(tool)``), which is a display spelling this
    projection does not compare against. With no fold there is no collision this
    projection could manufacture, and the translated half is already keyed by name.

    These are withheld on this transport, and the whole of the argument is that
    codex's exemption for them was never about the wire — it was about having a
    SECOND channel to honour the restriction on.

    ``session_mcp_restricted_servers`` subtracts the control plane, because
    ``managed_mcp_spec_entry`` emits only command/args/env: a ``disabledTools`` on
    those two entries never reaches the element, so withholding on the strength of
    a key that was never delivered would be pure loss. codex completes that argument
    — it keeps the server mounted AND refuses a call to a switched-off tool when the
    adapter asks permission for it, so nothing is lost and nothing is widened.

    Neither half of that completion exists here. This harness emits no
    ``_meta.kiro`` and no ``rawInput.server``/``tool`` — only a fused
    ``<server>_<tool>`` title — so ``AcpClient._deny_spec_disabled_tool`` has no
    identity to match, and whether it asks for an MCP tool call at all under
    ``permission: ask`` is unmeasured. Carrying the exemption across on codex's
    reasoning while dropping the mechanism that made it safe would leave a tool the
    user switched off on the dashboard REACHABLE, on an ordinary path, with nothing
    saying so.

    So the rule this module already applies to a third-party server applies here
    too, in the module's own words: an availability cost is the honest price of a
    deny channel this transport does not have; reachability of a tool the user
    switched off is not. The cost is stated rather than hidden — a session whose
    control plane is narrowed loses that server, and with ``kirocrew-core`` gone it
    cannot report back to its channel at all — and it is paid ONLY by an operator
    who narrowed the control plane deliberately. A default install narrows nothing
    and is untouched, which is why this is not the "present but unusable" shape the
    folder exists to remove: the server is absent and logged, not mounted and mute.

    Derived from the ``(server, tool)`` PAIRS the caller already resolved, never
    from the spec again, so the withhold decision reads the same bytes as the array
    — and it sees a narrowing written to the GLOBAL settings file, which is where
    the dashboard's ordinary tool-off action writes it. Free of I/O.

        the call site. Once this backend is in ``MIRRORS``,
        ``AcpClient._pooled_mcp_servers`` returns ``[]`` for it, so this IS the stubs'
        only route in.

        Stubs are appended as given rather than run through :func:`opencode_elements`:
        they are gateway-authored, their env is the broker's own, and none of them is

        the global settings file too, so it can carry a stub for a server this agent
        never references, and a stub is that server.

    ``denied_tools`` is deliberately EMPTY, and that is a statement rather than a
        default. The client's per-call refusal (``AcpClient._deny_spec_disabled_tool``)
        identifies an MCP call from codex-acp's ``rawInput = {server, tool}``, which
        opencode does not emit, so pairs returned here could never match -- and a set

        for why codex's exemption does not extend to a transport with no second channel.

        ``permission_surface_owned`` is accepted and IGNORED (it arrives in
        ``kwargs``), which is the documented behaviour for a mirror outside
        claude's class. The flag exists because claude's permission surface is a
        file Crew may not own, so a pre-approved tool there never sends
        ``session/request_permission`` and Crew's gate never fires. opencode has no
        such file in play: its routing is seeded on ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` and
        then READ BACK from the harness's own config resolution, so a session whose
        resolved value is not the required one is refused before its first prompt.
        Failing closed on the flag here would withhold every Crew tool from every
        opencode session on the strength of a condition that does not describe this
        backend.

        ``session_key`` and ``channel_id`` are the caller's, because a mirror
        cannot discover them. On this harness they scope rather than supply: the
        MCP child inherits the ambient environment, so without them a
        control-plane child would come up holding the GATEWAY's session key
        instead of this session's.

        ``work_dir`` is the session's project checkout and is required for
        CORRECTNESS, not convenience: kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against
        ``<work_dir>/.kiro/agents`` as well as the user level, so omitting it makes
        a project-only agent read as "no spec" and drops the ``tools`` allowlist
        that spec declared.

        ``stub_elements`` are the shared gateway's broker stubs for this session,
        which the caller holds (it owns the overlay) and this mirror places, so the
        withhold rule covers both halves of the array -- see
        :func:`opencode_projection`.

        Blocking -- it reads the agent spec. The caller warms this on the opencode
        spawn path and serves the shared ``session/new`` call site from that cache
        (harness-parity H13).
