"""Projects the agent spec onto ``goose acp``.

The second single-binary spec harness to carry a session ``mcpServers`` array, and
the array's MECHANICS are the same ones :mod:`kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.opencode`
already owns: the same shared translation
(:func:`kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp.session_mcp_servers`, no new translator), the same
``tools`` allowlist, the same registry filter, the same control-plane re-derivation,
and the same one-owner rule for the pooled broker stubs. So this module DELEGATES to
that one's module-level functions rather than restating them, and carries what is
actually goose's: the rulings prose, and the two wire facts that differ.

What differs, and neither changes the projection:

* The tool-name grammar is ``<server>__<tool>`` -- two underscores, and no ``mcp__``
  prefix -- where opencode fuses with one. goose also carries the pair separately as
  ``_meta.goose.toolCall.toolName`` and ``extensionName``.
* An element whose command cannot start is DROPPED rather than failing
  ``session/new`` whole.

The duplication that remains between the two harnesses is the mirror CLASS, not the
mechanics: a shared base for "single binary, spec dialect, session array" is a
refactor of both, which is not this change's to make.
