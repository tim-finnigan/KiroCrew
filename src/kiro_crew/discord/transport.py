"""Layer 1 -- Discord as a concrete :class:`MessagingTransport`.

Wraps the low-level :class:`DiscordClient` (Gateway WebSocket + REST) in the
channel-neutral transport contract, so the Discord channel rides the shared
``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval ladder + SEL audit)
instead of a hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``discord``.

Security: :meth:`authorize` is **deny-by-default**. A Discord bot can be DM'd
by anyone who shares a server with it, so an empty ``allowed_user_ids`` MUST
authorize nobody. Guild traffic additionally requires either an exact thread-ID
allow-list match or an approved channel whose message can be promoted into a
new thread; turns never run directly in a normal guild channel.

        Discord keeps two rosters because it has two audiences, so this dispatches
        on the route rather than testing one id against the wrong set.

        A **thread** route is recognised by its conversation id being in
        ``_allowed_threads``, the same set ``receive`` gates inbound on. Matched on
        the conversation id and NOT on ``thread_id``: a Discord thread's snowflake IS
        its channel id, and the persisted link is built as
        ``ChannelLink("discord", channel_id=...)`` with no thread id at all, so a
        check keyed on ``thread_id`` never fires and every thread would fall to the
        DM arm and be refused for want of a principal. Snowflakes are unique, so a
        DM channel id cannot collide into this set.

        Consulting the thread set keeps outbound exactly as tight as inbound, which
        also settles the auto-created case: those ids are registered in memory only,
        so after a restart such a thread cannot drive a turn either, and
        continuing to post into it would make outbound the more permissive of the two.
        A thread REMOVED from the roster falls through to the DM arm, where a forum
        session key names no principal, so revocation still refuses it.

        A **DM** route is checked against ``_allowed`` via *principal*, and refuses
        when there is none. The conversation id cannot answer that one: a DM link
        persists the channel id returned by ``create_dm_channel``, which is
        unrelated to the user snowflake the roster holds, and re-deriving the
        pairing is a POST a synchronous per-send seam cannot make. So with no
        principal there is nothing left to consult, and an unidentifiable DM
        recipient is exactly the case that must not be waved through: this is a
        network egress boundary, and the caller audits the refusal.

        Two routes name no peer in their session KEY. A dashboard-born session
        mirrored into a DM is served anyway, from the record the GATEWAY wrote when
        it admitted the mirror: the link carries the peer (``ChannelLink.principal``)
        under a MAC the gateway alone can mint (``mirror_admission``, keyed from the
        sandbox-masked token signing key over the session key and the whole
        location), and the ladder hands that peer in here as *principal* only when
        the MAC verifies. The session map is writable by in-sandbox code, so an
        unsigned or rewritten row -- one pointed at another user's DM, or given
        another user's name -- fails verification and is refused, and a key rotation
        refuses every such mirror until it is re-linked. This transport's own pairing
        (:meth:`direct_peer_of`) is read as well, as defense in depth: when the client
        knows which user a channel belongs to and that disagrees with the record, the
        record loses; when it knows nothing (a DM this process has not opened or seen,
        the ordinary state right after a restart) the verified record stands, which is
        what keeps this check admitting the mirror across a restart with no inbound
        message. One residual is the REST ladder's own mid-send re-check
        (:meth:`_still_may_send_to`), which reads the pairing alone: a send that hits
        one of the ladder's waits before the pairing is re-learned is still refused
        there, while a send that never waits is delivered. The
        route that stays refused is a ``unified`` DM bucket bound from inside the
        channel, whose link records no peer. Refusing costs an unattended notice
        there and is the correct trade: that bucket deliberately collapses SEVERAL
        peers into one session, so nothing available to this seam establishes which
        of them the link currently points at. Sessions under the default
        ``per-channel-peer`` scope carry their peer in the key and are unaffected.

        The ladder asks this after each of its own waits, holding a channel id and
        nothing else, so this answers strictly what a channel id can settle and
        refuses when even that much is missing. Three arms decide everything a
        channel id can decide:

        * an id on the thread roster, or on the shared-channel roster, passes --
          the same sets ``receive`` gates inbound on and :meth:`may_send_to`
          consults, so a destination an operator withdraws stops being written to
          mid-send. Both CURRENT rosters are read first, so moving an id between
          ``allowed_thread_ids`` and ``allowed_channel_ids`` reads as the
          reclassification it is rather than as a withdrawal;
        * an id paired with a DM peer is decided on THAT peer, so the roster is
          asked about the one user the message would actually reach. Every writer of
          that pairing is DM-gated, which is what makes the pairing's presence a
          reliable statement that the id is a DM channel and not a guild one;
        * anything left is REFUSED. An id on no roster is either withdrawn or never
          admitted, and a DM channel whose peer is not derivable here -- the DM
          roster is keyed by the peer's user id while a DM link persists the channel
          id ``create_dm_channel`` returned, and the pairing is not re-derivable
          synchronously -- cannot be told from a withdrawn one. At a network egress
          boundary "cannot tell" reads as no. Asking instead whether the roster
          admits ANYBODY would let one remaining peer authorize a different, revoked
          one.

        A refusing final arm is what keeps this short: an id no roster and no pairing
        can place is refused by it, so a separate record of what was once admitted
        would answer after the same refusal and change nothing.

        The cost of that last arm is an unattended proactive DM whose destination was
        read back from a link written before a restart, and which served one of the
        ladder's waits: it is refused rather than delivered. The alternative is
        delivering to a peer whose authorization may already be gone, which is the
        thing this exists to stop. A caller that needs the send to survive can re-open
        the DM through ``create_dm_channel``, which establishes the pairing.

        Each refusal names its OWN ground, because only here can the two be told
        apart: a peer the roster refuses is a withdrawal, while an id nothing
        can place is a destination this process cannot attribute. The caller reports
        whichever it is, so an operator reading a dropped notification is not told a

        A Discord DM link persists the channel id ``create_dm_channel`` returned,

        record that call (and an authorized inbound DM or button press) leaves --
        ``cached_dm_recipient``, the same pairing :meth:`_still_may_send_to`
        decides on. Every writer of that pairing is DM-gated, so an answer is also
        the statement that the id is a DM channel and not a guild one; a guild
        channel or thread id is never paired and reads ``""``.

        This is what the per-send recipient leg reads as defense in depth for a
        dashboard-born session's mirror: the gateway-signed record on the link names
        the peer, and when this pairing knows the channel too the two must agree --
        a disagreement refuses the send, whatever the record says.

        In-process only, by the pairing's own contract: a DM opened before a
        restart names nobody until the bot re-opens it or the peer writes into it,
        and the reader treats ``""`` as "not on record" rather than as a
        contradiction -- the verified record stands at the recipient leg, so a
        restart costs no admission there (the mid-send re-check, which reads this
