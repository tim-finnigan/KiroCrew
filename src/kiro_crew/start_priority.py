"""Start priority: which waiting session start a bounded start queue serves next.

Three in-process queues bound an agent start, and all three are a
:class:`PrioritySemaphore`: ``SessionManager._start_sem`` (provider cold starts),
the gateway-wide cold-start admission (runtime spawn + ``initialize``) and the
``SessionStartGate`` (``session/new``).

THE RULE (stated here once; call sites and docs point back to it).

* Every start is ``BACKGROUND`` unless its caller claims ``FOREGROUND`` explicitly,
  and a caller claims it only where a person is waiting on that start. Nothing is
  derived from a session key: automation runs on interactive keys too (an auto-nudge
  wake, a cron or sub-agent completion injection, an agent's ``session_send``), so a
  key says where a turn lands, not who is waiting for it.
* The claimers are listed in ``docs/system-specs/modules/acp-client.md``
  § Session-start gate.

Ordering: FIFO within a priority, ``FOREGROUND`` first, bounded so background is
never starved: after :data:`_FOREGROUND_BYPASS_LIMIT` consecutive ``FOREGROUND``
grants that passed a queued ``BACKGROUND`` waiter, the oldest ``BACKGROUND`` waiter is
served next. Strict priority plus a named bypass rather than weighted round-robin,
because a person waiting must win outright whenever the bypass allows.

This module is neutral on purpose: the session layer and the ACP runtime both read
it, and application code may not import ``kiro_crew.acp``
(``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py``).

    The acquire/release shape of :class:`asyncio.Semaphore`, except that ``release``
    takes the priority the permit was acquired at, and one naming a class that holds
    nothing raises rather than corrupting the per-class count (a mismatch while that
    class holds another permit is indistinguishable from that holder's own release,
    so every caller pairs the two through :meth:`held` or :meth:`drain`). FIFO within a
    priority, ordering per the module docstring. A freed permit is handed directly
    to the waiter it wakes, so a newcomer cannot take it first; a waiter granted and
    then cancelled before it resumed hands the permit on.

    ``foreground_reserve`` permits are ones ``BACKGROUND`` may never hold, so
    ``BACKGROUND`` gets ``value - foreground_reserve`` and the reserve sits on top of
    that. It exists for a semaphore whose holders wait in further queues while
    holding it (``SessionManager._start_sem``), where ordering alone cannot help a
    person once every permit is held by a background start stuck further in.

    :meth:`drain` takes EVERY permit and outranks both priorities while it waits.

    ``_value`` is the free-permit count, spelled as :class:`asyncio.Semaphore` spells
    it. Loop-agnostic until a waiter queues: a waiter's future is created on the
    running loop, which is why the gateway keys its admission registries by loop.
