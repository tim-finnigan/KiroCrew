"""The committed queue generation, kept where the transcript's editor cannot reach.

A slot's queued prompts persist on its session's metadata line, an ordinary
agent-writable file. Every record of one durable write is sealed under the
write's GENERATION (``slot_queue_repository.ORIGIN_GENERATION_KEY``), which is
what lets the restore refuse a record kept from an older write and slipped in
beside the current ones: the line then carries two generations, which no write
of this gateway produces. What the line alone cannot refuse is a line REPLACED
WHOLE by an older one -- every record on it names the same, older generation,
every seal verifies under it, and a ``/goal`` or ``/workflow`` the gateway had
already consumed comes back and runs again with the authority it was queued
with. Told from the line alone, that rollback is indistinguishable from a crash
before the newer write landed. So it is not told from the line alone.

This module keeps, for each slot, the generation of the durable write this
gateway LAST COMMITTED for it -- in a top-level crew-home directory
(:data:`STORE_DIR_LEAF`) that is masked from every sandboxed process
(``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``, pre-created before the mask so a fresh home
has a name to cover), fenced from the agent file tools and every shell form
(``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``), and opened only by the gateway process,
directly. The save commits the generation here around the line's own commit
(``chat_persistence``; the two writes are described below), and the restore
REQUIRES it: told against the record,
a line whose one generation is not the committed one -- older, newer, absent,
or two of them -- is a line this gateway did not write last, and every record on
it is rejected; told against NO record for the transcript, a line that carries a
generation is nothing to honour and every record on it is dropped under its own
notice, not the tamper one (``slot_queue_repository.restore_queue_provenance``,
its three outcomes). The record is worth what
the fence and the mask are worth, which is what ``token_signing.key`` is
worth: it carries no secret and certifies nothing by itself, so it is not
signed.

A record names the TRANSCRIPT INCARNATION it was committed for, not only the
slot key. A slot key is reused: a session permanently deleted and a new one
opened under the same key is a new transcript, whose metadata line carries its
own ``created_at`` (minted with the line, carried through every rewrite --
``chat_persistence`` reads it as the file's identity for exactly this reason).
Keyed by the slot key alone, a record would outlive the transcript it was
committed for, and the deleted transcript put back from a copy -- a consumed,
sealed ``/goal`` among its entries -- would verify under it. So the save binds
the record to the committed line's ``created_at``, the restore reads it only for
the line that names the same one, and the permanent delete TOMBSTONES the
record (``handlers/sessions._delete_history_session``): the record is state
that must not survive into the next session on a recycled slot key. The
tombstone is two-phase, because the delete it belongs to can refuse AFTER it --
the ledger exclusion may be unwritable, the transcript's own unlink refuses on
a search-index row it cannot drop or an attachments directory it cannot move
-- and a record gone from under a transcript that survives is that
transcript's queued prompts dropped, with the notice, at the next restart. So
the record is first MOVED ASIDE, one rename inside the store directory
(:func:`stage_queue_generation_tombstone`; a move that fails refuses the
delete with the row intact and nothing written, as the ledger exclusion beside
it does), moved BACK by the same rename when any later step refuses
(:meth:`StagedTombstone.rollback`), and unlinked only once the transcript is
gone (:meth:`StagedTombstone.purge`) -- the last irreversible step, and one
whose failure leaves a name the restore never reads.

The save writes the store TWICE around the line, so that the two never name
different writes by accident. Before the line is written, the generation the
line is about to carry is recorded as PENDING beside the committed one
(:func:`stage_pending_generation`); after the line is on disk it is committed
and every pending one cleared (:func:`commit_queue_generation`). A process that
dies between the two leaves the store naming the line's generation as pending,
and the restore honours a line sealed under a pending generation of its own
incarnation -- "honoured-pending": the queue comes back with its provenance, and
the commit it is owed is finished by the next flush pass, which re-saves the
line (``chat_persistence``). Without the pending write an ordinary interrupted
save read as a tamper -- the committed generation stood at the previous write's
while the line named the new one -- and the queue was dropped, the very loss the
record exists to prevent.

The pending generations are a LIST, carried until a commit prunes them, because
a save's commit can be REFUSED (a transient error on the store, answered as
False) with its line already on disk. The save then leaves the queue owed and
the next pass retries -- under a FRESH generation, since every write of a value
that moved since the last commit mints its own (``_ChatSlot.begin_durable_queue_
write``: one generation per write, so two writes never share one). That retry
stages its new generation BEFORE it writes its line, and for as long as its line
is not on disk -- the process lost right there, or the line's own write refused
-- the line on disk is still the previous save's, sealed under the previous
generation. A stage that REPLACED the pending generation dropped that one from
the store while its line still stood, and the restore then read the gateway's
own last write as a tamper (GPT, r26). So the stage APPENDS: the store names the
committed generation and every generation staged since it, newest last, and the
restore honours a line naming any one of them; the commit that finally lands
names the line it followed as committed and clears the rest, whose lines that
commit's own line replaced. The list is bounded (:data:`_MAX_PENDING_GENERATIONS`,
the newest kept): a bound reached is that many consecutive saves whose commit
was refused, each warned about, and the oldest generation dropped is the one on
disk only if every line write since it failed too. What still reads as a tamper
is a line naming a generation the store holds NEITHER as committed NOR as
pending: a rollback past the committed write, a relabel, or a save whose pending
write was itself refused (warned about at the time) and which then died before
the commit.

One cost remains, fail-closed and stated so nobody reads it as a bug: an
operator who restores an older transcript from a backup restores a queue this
gateway will not honour; the prompts on it are dropped with the notice and must
be re-sent. That is not a replay of a consumed command, which is the harm the
record exists to remove.

Every function is blocking file IO and runs OFF the event loop only: the save
runs in an executor (or a synchronous caller's thread), the restore reads the
record in its prefetch half (``_prefetch_rehydrate_inputs``,
``_prefetch_recent_session``), beside the metadata line it belongs to, and the
delete runs in the worker thread that holds the transcript lock.
