"""``/api/acp-backends`` -- per-backend selectability and machine readiness.

One row per backend id in ``acp_backends.ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN``, sorted by
``policy_id``, including ids this build cannot serve: the dashboard's backend
switch lists all of them and must be able to say which is which, so an
unservable backend needs a row rather than silent absence.

Four facts per row, from four owners that must not be conflated:

* ``selectable`` -- build capability AND deployment policy, read from
  ``handlers.core._selectable_acp_backends()``. That helper is already the
  single derivation feeding the PATCH allowlist and ``/api/config/schema``, and
  it already applies the ``agent_backend`` governance scope. Re-deriving it here
  from ``acp_backends.selectable_backend_values()`` would restore exactly the
  drift that a literal list in three places once caused: the wire would accept
  a value this endpoint calls unselectable, or the reverse.
* ``installed`` -- whether the harness is on THIS machine, from
  :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk`, which asks through the spawn's own resolvers.
  Reached through the SDK rather than the ACP layer directly: this handler is
  application code, and ``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`` is what keeps
  that true.
* ``auth`` -- how the harness signs in, projected from its one declaration in
  ``agent_sdk.host_auth``. Installed and signed-in are different questions with
  different remedies, and a panel that only had ``installed`` could show a green
  row for a harness whose every session dies at start on an authentication
  error. Nothing here READS a credential: the declaration is static data, so the
  row says which store holds the entitlement and what to run, and never that a
  particular harness is currently signed in.
* the CARD -- ``capabilities``, ``security_notes``, ``operator_notes``,
  ``tool_approval`` and ``offered_by_build``, projected from the harness's own
  capability memberships
  by :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_cards`. This is the question the other
  three cannot answer: an operator is choosing between harnesses, and
  selectability plus install state say only whether a choice is available, never
  what it costs. The projection is spread into the row rather than nested under
  one key, because each of those four is a field the panel reads on its own.

  The classification -- which memberships are user-facing, which are operator
  notes, and which reach no card at all -- belongs to the projection and not to
  this handler or to the panel. A second place deciding it is a second place that
  can disagree about what a line means.

  A capability line carries THREE states, and this handler forwards all three
  untouched: ``available`` is a bool, and ``measured`` is false on the cells the
  projection declares nobody has driven yet. Nothing here collapses the pair,
  which is the one thing that would matter -- ``available`` is already false on an
  unmeasured line, so a reader of that field alone gets the fail-closed answer,
  and a handler that dropped ``measured`` would silently turn "no answer yet" into
  "this harness cannot".

Owner-only, and the snapshot is offloaded: the Claude probe shells out to mise
and walks the filesystem, and resolving the governance ceiling loads config, so
neither may run on the event loop.

## Why there are two verbs

The GET reports; it never mutates. That is why ``restart_required`` exists at
all: a harness installed AFTER this gateway cached its absence reads as
installed-but-unusable, and every ``*_cached_negative`` seam in
``agent_sdk.drivers.acp`` documents that it CONSULTS the spawn path's cache
rather than clearing it, because a replayable, unattributed read must not have a
side effect.

An operator who has just run the install command the panel printed is in exactly
that state, and telling them to restart the gateway is a real cost for a fact only
this process still believes. So the clear is offered as its OWN request:
``POST /api/acp-backends/recheck`` names one backend, drops what this process cached
about it, re-probes, and returns that one row.

The VERB is what makes the mutation legitimate. Every ``*_cached_negative`` seam
documents that it only ever consults the spawn path's cache, and the rule behind that
is about replayability: a GET is unattributed and may be retried by anything, so a
side effect inside one is a mutation nobody requested. A POST is the request that
did. It is owner-gated, validated, and audited, and the GET's contract is unchanged.

**The clear runs on the event loop; only the probe is offloaded.** That split is
load-bearing, not tidiness -- see :func:`api_acp_backend_recheck` and the driver
seam's own docstring. Doing it the other way round is a real defect: every reader on
the spawn path has no ``await`` between its check and its read, so a clear from a
worker thread can land inside that pair and either raise ``KeyError`` in a session
spawn or make an installed adapter report "not found".

``restart_required`` is not suppressed by the re-check, only unblocked. The re-probe
reads it from the spawn path again AFTER the clear, so a component this process
somehow still holds a negative for keeps saying so. There is no parameter here that
writes a verdict.
