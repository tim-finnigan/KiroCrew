    * :func:`reject_if_kiro_unverified` -- the scrape shells out to ``kiro-cli
      chat``, which opens a browser login while signed out (same as the GET).
    * Single flight -- while a refresh is in progress (the timer's or another

      than started: a refresh is a whoami + scrape subprocess pair that can
      take up to :data:`_USAGE_FETCH_DEADLINE_SECS`, and two of them for one
      reading is waste. Checked synchronously against ``_usage_fetching`` with
      no await in between, and :func:`_fetch_usage_bg` sets the flag before
      its first await, so two requests on the same loop cannot both pass.
    * Back-off -- reported, not pre-checked. The refresh runs the free API
      attempt regardless of the scrape's state; only when the API yields no
      plan AND the scrape is parked -- parked before this refresh, or parked
      BY this refresh's own failed attempt (the third miss) -- does the

#: Session namespaces whose transcripts are a machine run rather than a conversation
#: anyone addressed. This membership is a PRESENTATION judgement for one pane, not a
#: shared roster: two other modules carry similar-looking tuples that answer different
#: questions, and none of the three agree.
#:
#: * ``handlers/_shared.py`` — colon-only, wf-family only, to dispatch a memory-mode
#:   lookup. Includes ``wf-scope``.
#: * ``handlers/cron.py`` — colon-only, wf-family plus ``subagent``, to answer whether a
#:   session is live and shared. Omits ``wf-scope``; suspected pre-existing gap in that
#:   predicate rather than a deliberate exclusion.
#: * this one — matches PERSISTED folded keys via ``_in_namespace``, adds ``secretary``
#:   and ``channel``, and deliberately excludes ``cron``, ``side`` and ``taskrunner``
#:   because each of those holds conversations a reader started.
#:
#: So do not hoist the three into one constant: it would force a shared meaning none of
#: them has, and the next namespace would have to be correct for all three at once.
#:
#: It is spelled literally rather than derived from
#: ``messaging.link._TELEMETRY_LOCAL_PREFIXES`` because that registry exists to bound
#: telemetry label cardinality, and ``wf-unpooled``, ``wf-worker`` and ``wf-scope`` are
#: all live session keys absent from it — a derived filter cannot see them.
#:
#: Absent on purpose:
#:
#: * ``dashboard`` and the channel namespaces (``slack``, ``discord``, …) — the
#:   reader's own conversations.
#: * ``cron`` — a job without ``hide_in_chat`` backs a real chat slot, and the key
#:   does not record which kind wrote it.
#: * ``side`` — the slot's own side panel, which the reader typed into; ``sel.py``
#:   attributes ``side:`` to the ``dashboard`` surface for that reason.
#: * ``taskrunner`` — ``POST /api/taskrunner/{id}/to-chat`` opens a real chat slot on
#:   ``taskrunner:<task_id>:chat:<token>`` and titles it ``Plan: <task_id>``, so the
#:   namespace holds conversations as well as runs and the key cannot reliably tell
#:   them apart. Listing a plain ``taskrunner_`` run is the declared residual, and it
#:   is the safe one: showing a machine row costs less than hiding a conversation.
#:
#: Anything not named here stays listed, which is the direction every residual in
#: this filter points.

    """Per history key, the STORE-side owner keys whose transcript is that row.

    Returns ``{history key: exact owner keys}``. Raises ``CronStoreBusy`` (past the
    shared bounded backoff) and ``CronStoreUnreadable`` — the store's own two ways
    of saying it cannot be seen — so the caller refuses the delete with a distinct
    code for each. Any other failure is logged and answers ``{}``: unknown, proceed
    loudly.

    The transcript's ``linked_session_key`` is the funnel's primary source for a
    channel session's exact owner key, but it cannot be the only one. Two states
    have a channel-owned job and NO such metadata, and neither is an error:

    * the ORDERING WINDOW — ``cron_add`` stamps the channel key on the job in one
      transaction while the slot save publishes ``linked_session_key`` in
      another, so a delete landing between them reads absent metadata over a job
      that is already owned.
    * a LEGACY transcript written before that metadata existed at all.

    In both, "absent" means "not recorded here", not "no owner to lose" — and
    absent is also the ordinary state of every dashboard session, so refusing the
    delete is not available as an answer. So the binding is resolved from the
    OTHER side: the store knows each job's exact owner key, and this row's own
    transcript stem says which owner keys name THIS conversation. A job whose
    owner folds onto that stem owns this row, and its exact key -- the spelling
    the release needs and the stem cannot reconstruct (``_safe_key`` maps every
    ``:`` to ``_``) -- is right there on the job.

    Matched on the row's OWN stem, never a stripped one. An owner matches when
    this row's stem is one of the filenames THAT owner logs under -- its canonical
    stem or, for a Slack thread predating the ``slack:<ts>`` key, the bare
    ``thread_ts`` stem ``ConversationLog._path`` still falls back to (hence
    ``transcript_stems``: the canonical stem alone misses a legacy transcript's
    owner silently, and the delete then strands it). What this deliberately does
    NOT do is strip a ``dashboard_`` prefix off the ROW to reach ``slack_<ts>``,
    even though ``dashboard_slack_<ts>`` is a real shape for a pre-migration
    leftover tab whose conversation IS ``slack:<ts>``: the stripped form names a
    DIFFERENT session, derived from a string a client chose (``POST
    /api/chat/slots`` takes the slot name), so honouring it releases a LIVE
    channel session's jobs when an unrelated dashboard row is deleted for being
    spelled like it.

    No marker on the transcript can license that fold. ``linked_session_key`` and
    ``channel_origin`` both live on the metadata line of an AGENT-WRITABLE file,
    so an agent that can create the lookalike transcript can write the marker onto
    it — a marker-gated fold is as reachable as an ungated one, one step longer.
    Nor is there a server-side record to consult instead: the absent-metadata case
    is precisely the SLOTLESS one, so there is no live slot holding provenance.

    Hence the rule this function fails closed on: provenance for a destructive
    CROSS-SESSION action must come from outside agent-writable storage, and where
    none exists the action is not inferred. The cost is a genuinely channel-born
    leftover keeping a job owned by a session that is gone — bounded, visible
    (:func:`_warn_unprovable_channel_binding` names the owner, the candidate ids
    and the recovery command) and RECOVERABLE by id with ``kirocrew cron adopt
    <id> --release``. A forged release is none of those things.

    A PRESENT ``linked_session_key`` is a different question and is still
    honoured: :func:`_linked_session_key_for_history_key` asks whether the claim
    the row already carries is about ITSELF, comparing the agent-written value
    against the route-derived history key. That comparison can only NARROW what a
    row reaches, never widen it to a session the row does not name.

    Swept for EVERY delete rather than only when metadata is absent. Knowing it
    is absent means having read it, and that read lives inside the same lock hold
    as the unlink (see :func:`_delete_history_session`) precisely so no
    writer can land a key between them; splitting the hold to decide whether to
    sweep would reopen that window to save one cache-warm read. When metadata IS
    present the sweep simply agrees with it, and a duplicate candidate costs
    nothing: ``release_jobs_owned_by`` re-resolves ownership and liveness inside
    the store lock, so nothing here can release a job the store disagrees about.

    Reads through ``owner_keys_async`` — a STRICT locked scan that reloads through
    ``_sync_for_write`` and RAISES on either store failure. Neither cache-shaped
    read can be used here, and the distinction is the whole point of the sweep:
    ``list_jobs`` lags a cross-process write by up to one timer poll, and
    ``list_jobs_async`` locks but DEGRADES — it swallows ``CronStoreBusy`` to
    return the cache, and syncs through ``_sync()``, whose ``_load`` flattens an
    unreadable store to an empty job list. Both answer "no owners" for a store
    that could not be read, which is the one answer this caller must not accept:
    it is about to destroy the last record of the binding.

    Only the STORE's own two ways of saying "you cannot see me" fail CLOSED, and
    each PROPAGATES so the caller can name the cause: sustained ``CronStoreBusy``
    (retried on the shared backoff first) and ``CronStoreUnreadable``. In those the
    job set is unknown rather than empty, so the caller refuses instead of
    unlinking the last record of a binding it could not check, and answers with a
    code and remedy specific to the cause — a busy store wants a retry, an
    unreadable one wants the file repaired, and the by-id CLI cannot help with
    either. An UNEXPECTED exception is different in kind: not the store's verdict
    but a defect or an environment failure this sweep never named (a mock in a
    test, an ``OSError`` off a network mount), on a read that fronts EVERY history
    delete and the bulk clear. Refusing on it would let one cron-read fault block
    all history deletion, so the unknown case proceeds LOUDLY: the exception, the
    session keys and the by-id recovery command are logged at WARNING, no owner is
    released on the strength of a read that did not happen, and the delete goes
    ahead. That is the strand-and-recover posture
    :func:`_warn_unprovable_channel_binding` already takes — a job left owned by a
    departed session is bounded, visible and recoverable by id, and the
    alternative here is unbounded. An object with no ``owner_keys_async`` is a
    different case entirely and is quiet: nothing to sweep, nothing withheld.

    The stranded-binding warning is emitted only where the row's name suggests a
    binding this refuses to infer, which is rare — a leftover-shaped row with a
    matching owner in the store — so the ordinary delete pays nothing for it.

    ``slot_history_key`` returns ``linked_session_key`` verbatim as the slot's
    transcript key whenever it is set, so the binding is not a free-form pointer:
    a row carrying a linked key must BE that key's own transcript. That makes the
    expected relationship checkable from the history key alone, which is what
    :func:`_linked_session_key_for_history_key` needs — the history key arrives
    from the route or the session list and is not attacker-writable, while the
    metadata value is.

    Only the row's CANONICAL stem. A leftover-shaped name is deliberately NOT
    stripped to reach the channel session it is spelled like: ``dashboard:slack_
    <ts>`` is not the session ``slack:<ts>``, so admitting the stripped form would
    WIDEN the row to a session it does not name -- and since the transcript store
    is agent-writable, a forged ``linked_session_key`` on a lookalike file would
    then release a LIVE channel session's cron ownership on any history delete.
    That is the same stance :func:`_owner_keys_bound_to_transcript` takes on the
    store side, for the same reason, so the two cannot disagree about what a row
    may reach.

    The bare ``thread_ts`` stem a Slack thread predating the canonical
    ``slack:<ts>`` key still logs under needs no entry here: it is contributed on
    the VALUE side by ``transcript_stems``, where ``ConversationLog._path``'s
    fallback lives.

    A genuinely channel-born leftover therefore keeps its job owned by a session
    that is gone. That cost is bounded, visible -- the sweep's
    :func:`_warn_unprovable_channel_binding` names the owner, the candidate job
    ids and the command -- and RECOVERABLE by id through ``kirocrew cron adopt
    <id> --release``. A forged release is none of those things.

    Scoped to VALIDATING a link the row already carries: the row is CLAIMING a
    binding, and the check asks only whether the claim is about itself, comparing
    the agent-written value against the route-derived key. Restricted to the
    canonical stem, that comparison can only ever NARROW what this row reaches.

def _linked_session_key_for_history_key(log: Any, key: str) -> tuple[str, bool]:
    """``(exact session key or "", metadata was READABLE)`` for a history row.

    A channel-born tab persists ``linked_session_key`` in its transcript
    metadata because nothing recreates that binding on restart. Cron jobs the
    session created are stamped with THAT key, not with any ``dashboard:``
    spelling of the transcript name, so it is the only string that can match
    their owner — and after the transcript is unlinked there is nowhere left to
    read it from.

    Reads through ``get_metadata_status``, not ``get_metadata``, and reports the
    readability flag rather than folding it away. The two cases the caller has to
    tell apart both answer ``""``:

    * **ABSENT** — no metadata line, or a metadata line carrying no
      ``linked_session_key`` (readable ``True``). ``{}`` is this case, not a
      quieter malformed one: it is the store's own answer for a row with no
      metadata line and for a first line that is not metadata-typed. There is no
      owner key to lose, so the delete proceeds.
    * **UNREADABLE** — an existing metadata line that could not be read, or that
      came back in a shape this cannot trust: a partial write, a prior ENOSPC,
      on-disk corruption, an agent-edited transcript (readable ``False``,
      including every exception this raises). The row MAY name a cron owner, and
      the unlink destroys the only copy, so deleting here strands that ownership
      with nothing left to notice it — :func:`_warn_stranded_cron_ownership`
      fires only when a release FAILS, never when the key was never read. The
      caller refuses the delete instead.

    A successful read is NOT automatically a trustworthy one. Two payloads are
    reported unreadable rather than folded into the absent case, because each
    would otherwise answer ``""`` (or a key that should never have been honoured)
    and let the delete proceed on a row that may well name an owner:

    * a payload that is not a ``dict`` at all — a bare string, a list, a scalar.
      The store's contract is a mapping, so anything else means the line was
      salvaged, hand-edited or partially written, and its ``linked_session_key``
      is unreadable rather than absent.
    * a ``linked_session_key`` present but not a ``str``. The only writer
      (``slot_projection``) persists a string field, so a mapping or a list here
      is corruption; ``str()``-ing it would mint a key that matches no job, and
      the release would report success having matched nothing.

    A ``linked_session_key`` that does not name THIS row (see
    :func:`_linkable_stems_for_history_key`) is a third case, and deliberately
    not an unreadable one: it answers ``("", True)`` with a warning, so the
    delete proceeds and releases nothing on account of the claim. The transcript
    store is agent-writable, so the value is untrusted INPUT to a privileged
    action -- whatever it names is fed to ``release_jobs_owned_by`` as a retired
    owner, and left unvalidated an agent that can write metadata would point its
    own row at a VICTIM session and have this delete clear the cron ownership of
    the victim. Dropping the claim keeps that closed. Refusing the delete did
    more than that: the mismatch is a property of the file, so a legitimate
    pre-migration leftover tab (``dashboard_slack_<ts>``) was refused identically
    on every retry, and the 409 remedy (release by id, delete again) could never
    clear it.

    only a shared unit comes back out -- a delete of this slot proceeded, and the
    document may be the deleted conversation's, so the tombstone stands.

    One thread hop for the whole transaction, because both halves block: the listing
    walks the crew-log root and reads a header per unit, and the write fsyncs under the

    live successor whose unit lands under the same key. Two things keep the successor's
    record out of it -- the captured session GENERATION must still be current, and the
    unit the slot is serving on NOW is never excluded. The removal itself is fenced by
    ACP session id and does not need this; the exclusion does, because its key is the
    recyclable one.

    BOTH are re-read AFTER the listing, immediately before the ids are persisted, because
    either read taken before it cannot describe what the listing then returned. What makes
    the second generation read sufficient rather than merely narrower: a successor's unit
    is written by a session that published its reservation on the slot key first, and that
    publication ADVANCES the generation -- so a unit new enough to be a successor's cannot
    be in the listing without the generation having already moved by the time it is

    # stale state is reversible, while deleting a successor's state is not.

    # The append-only CREW LOG is not one of those sidecars, and the difference is
    # mechanical rather than a re-reading of the rule above. A work ledger's identity
    # is the SLOT KEY, which is recycled, so no check here can prove a successor is not
    # about to inherit it. A crew-log unit is keyed by the ACP SESSION ID, and its
    # header -- written once inside the fenced tree -- names the slot it ran on, so the
    # units of THIS conversation can be told apart from anyone else's.
    #
    # A conversation owns one unit per ACP id it ran under: a reset, an agent or model
    # switch and a provider swap each start a new one. Which of them this delete takes
    # depends on what the claim proved.
    #
    # * A delete that tore down a slot takes the units the locked transaction excluded
    #   before the unlink (generation-proved, so never a successor's), plus the
    #   conversation's own unit only when the teardown SUCCEEDED: ``destroy_if``
    #   refuses for a replaced, busy or still-owned session, and that session may be
    #   writing right now. The write lease is no substitute, because ownership ends
    #   BETWEEN turns by design.
    # * A row with no open slot takes none. Its claim proves no unit id, and the slot
    #   key its headers name is recyclable: another conversation that reused it
    #   leaves superseded units the session map does not name, which a header
    #   match alone would hand to this delete. They are left to retention.

    ONE implementation, shared by ``api_sessions_clear`` and the clearable-count

    delete takes. Two implementations would let the dialog
    promise a number the delete does not honour, which is the whole reason a
    count exists.

    Takes NO age cutoff, deliberately. ``DELETE /api/sessions`` accepts none and
    removes every clearable session, so a count filtered by age would report a
    SUBSET of what the delete then permanently unlinks — a confirmation showing a
    smaller number than the delete honours. There is no cutoff to offer until the

    function.

    Returns ``(clearable, skipped, unreadable)``. A session is skipped when it is
    reachable as an open tab or when its metadata says ``pinned``. A session whose
    metadata could not be read is excluded and listed in ``unreadable`` by key,

    """Why this sleep should return early, or None to keep sleeping.

    Exactly two reasons, and the narrowness is the design:

    ``"user"``
        The End-wait button parked an explicit request naming this ``wait_id``,
        or another session parked the same request through ``session_end_wait``
        (``slot._end_wait_by`` then names it).

    ``"steer"``
        A mid-turn steer reached the backend AFTER this sleep began. kiro-cli
        can only inject a steer at a model-inference boundary and an in-flight
        tool call is the absence of one, so without this the user's correction
        sits in the backend's steer queue until the sleep elapses — up to the
        tool's 1800s ceiling — while the agent sleeps through it.

    "After this sleep began" is decided by comparing the provider's steer stamp
    against the reading taken when this sleep was minted, so the handler reads
    no clock of its own: the only two values ever compared are two readings of
    the same monotonic source. That is deliberate — a wall-clock stamp on one
    side and a monotonic one on the other is how a suspend silently reorders
    the comparison.

    Re-taking the baseline at every mint is also what makes the reason fire
    once. A steer the backend has accepted but not yet injected stays newer
    than nothing at all, so without a per-sleep baseline it would end sleep
    after sleep for the rest of the turn and hand the model a `wait` that
    returns instantly.

    Not extended to the other long block on this route. ``spawn_sub_agents``
    can wait 7200s on live sub-agents and pings the same endpoint, but sends no
    ``wait_id`` and so never reaches this decision — an exclusion worth keeping
    deliberately: ending a sleep discards nothing, while cutting a sub-agent
