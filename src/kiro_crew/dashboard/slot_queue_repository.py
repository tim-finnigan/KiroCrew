# This is well above the slot queue's legitimate in-flight set.  Eviction only
# bounds orphaned bookkeeping; an evicted agent remains recoverable on restart.
MAX_PENDING_SUBAGENT_DELIVERIES = 128

#: Cap on a slot's LIVE in-memory queue, shared by every producer that guards
#: an append against a full queue. One named constant because two bare
#: literals bounding the same population drift: the cron origin-injection path
#: (handlers/messaging.py) evicts the OLDEST entry at this cap, while the
#: MCP-App message path (handlers/mcp_apps.py) refuses the NEWEST — different
#: overflow semantics on purpose (a cron notification is periodic and
#: regenerates; an app message is a one-shot user action whose producer can be
#: told 429) — but the SIZE they guard is the same queue.
MAX_LIVE_QUEUE_ENTRIES = 50

#: How many queued user prompts one session's metadata line carries, and how
#: many a restore admits back. Front-first, because the front is what runs
#: first: an over-cap queue keeps the entries closest to delivery.
MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES = 32

#: Byte budget for the whole serialized ``queued_prompts`` value. The metadata
#: line is ONE json line every reader of the session parses, so an unbounded
#: set of long prompts would make it expensive for every reader rather than
#: only for the queue. Entries are admitted front-first until the budget is
#: spent; a prompt is never truncated, because a shortened prompt replayed as
#: the user's own words is worse than one reported as not carried.
MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_BYTES = 256_000

#: How many raw entries a restore INSPECTS, as distinct from how many it keeps.
#: A retention cap bounds this gateway's own writes; it does not bound a line
#: that was edited or corrupted outside the gateway into carrying a million
#: entries. The apply phase that calls :func:`sanitize_restored_queue` is
#: loop-affine (``_apply_recent_session``), so a scan proportional to the file's
#: content — even a cheap per-item scan — is startup work the event loop cannot
#: shed, and it blocks chat and heartbeat while it runs. Comfortably above the
#: retention cap so an ordinary line with a few dropped entries still restores
#: everything it should; entries past it are reported as not restored, never
#: silently ignored.
MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_SCAN = 4 * MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES

#: Queue-entry keys the durable copy carries. Everything else on an entry is
#: process-local plumbing (retry callbacks, synthetic payloads) or is
#: deliberately excluded — see :func:`durable_queue_entries`.
#:
#: ``_directive_user_origin`` and ``_directive_channel_origin`` are NOT here, and
#: their absence is a security property rather than an omission. They record that
#: an entry's words arrived from an authenticated human, and the drain turns that
#: into real authority: ``chat_runner`` reduces the consumed entries' flags into
#: ``producer_is_user_facing``, which admits user-surface and self-arming
#: directives and exempts them from the LINKED containment constraint. The
#: transcript this value is written to is an ordinary readable-writable file in
#: the crew home, not a write-protected one, so anything restored from it is
#: attacker-supplied for the purposes of that decision. Persisting provenance
#: that a later reader cannot distinguish from a hand-edited line would hand
#: human authority to whoever can write the file, so provenance is not carried
#: across a restart at all and restored entries fail closed to non-directive.
#: Marks an entry this process RESTORED rather than accepted. Process-local by
#: construction -- the writer emits only :data:`_DURABLE_QUEUE_KEYS`, so a
#: hand-edited line cannot clear it and cannot forge it either.
#:
#: It exists because dropping provenance is only half a fail-closed rule. A
#: restored entry carries no actor, and "no actor" resolves to ``user`` in the
#: drain -- which is exactly the arm ``model.route`` admits. So the absence has to
#: be readable as "unknown" rather than as "the person's", and this key is what a
#: consumer asks instead of trying to tell the two apart from the actor alone.
RESTORED_QUEUE_KEY = "_restored_from_disk"

#: Field of the DURABLE queue record (the persisted ``queued_prompts`` line, not
#: the live entry) carrying the gateway's own attestation of the entry's
#: PROVENANCE: where it came from -- the dashboard (the composer, an app, a
#: recovery of a dashboard turn) or a named channel conversation that handed it
#: off -- and the containment that held when it was accepted. It is the one
#: provenance a restored entry may carry across a restart, because it is the one
#: provenance a restart cannot forge: the RECORD SEAL, an HMAC over the slot key,
#: the write's GENERATION (:data:`ORIGIN_GENERATION_KEY`), the queue id, the
#: content, the entry's channel recipient (``session_control.CHANNEL_RECIPIENT_META_KEY``,
#: the conversation that handed it off; none for dashboard text) and its
#: admission-time containment snapshot, keyed from the
#: gateway's fenced signing secret (``token_signing.key``, which no agent file
#: tool can read or write), under its own domain tag so a queue proof is never
#: also a valid auth token (:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.queue_origin_token`).
#:
#: The rule it serves is DEFAULT DENY, in three parts. A restored entry carries no
#: command authority: the drain treats it as unproven prose -- no composer command
#: word, so a leading ``/workflow`` is text the turn reads, not a command it runs
#: and not one it refuses -- unless an ADDRESS-LESS proof verifies against it
#: (:func:`dashboard_origin_proven`). It
#: carries no admission snapshot -- it is re-checked against every constraint
#: that holds NOW, and on a linked or mirrored slot that drops it -- unless the
#: seal verifies over the snapshot the record carries. And it names no channel
#: conversation -- a released binding neither drops nor reports it -- unless the
#: seal verifies over the address the record carries. All three are read back
#: by :func:`restore_queue_provenance` from one verification, so a persisted
#: entry can be edited in any way an editor likes (its stamps removed or
#: rewritten, its content rewritten, a seal transplanted from another record or
#: slot) and comes back as unproven prose that fails closed; a dashboard entry
#: keeps its command word and its admission through a restart because its seal
#: still verifies; and a channel hand-off comes back exactly as it was queued --
#: channel text, bound to the conversation that sent it, admitted under the
#: containment it was accepted with -- so an entry whose binding still holds
#: drains and one whose binding changed is dropped WITH the notice to its
#: sender. Compare :data:`RESTORED_QUEUE_KEY`: that key says the entry was
#: restored, this one says what the gateway knew about it when it was accepted.
#:
#: A seal is good for ONE entry in ONE durable record of the write this gateway
#: COMMITTED LAST. It is recomputed over the entry it sits on, so a seal copied
#: onto another record proves nothing for it; a record carried twice under one id
#: is admitted once (:func:`sanitize_restored_queue`); and the generation is what
#: refuses a REPLAY -- a record kept from an older write of the same slot, whose
#: entry the gateway has since consumed or released, put back on the current
#: line. Every record of one write carries the write's generation, and the save
#: commits that generation OUTSIDE the transcript as it commits the line
#: (:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.queue_generation_store`, a fenced store the line's
#: editor cannot reach), so the restore honours a line only when its one
#: generation is the committed one: a line carrying two was never written by
#: this gateway, in whatever order the records sit; and a line REPLACED WHOLE by
#: an older write -- every seal on it verifying under its own, older generation,
#: entries the gateway had already consumed included -- names a generation other
#: than the committed one, and is rejected whole. The stale seal would not verify
#: under the line's generation anyway.
#:
#: Live, the proof beside the queue is the ATTESTATION -- ``owner._origin_proofs``,
#: keyed by queue id, like ``_last_enqueue_ts``; the same fields without a
#: generation -- and never on the entry: queue dicts are compared wholesale on the
#: wire and across the suite (the facade hands back the caller's own ``meta``
#: object), so the board and every ``to_dict`` projection see exactly what was
#: enqueued. The durable writer seals each attested record it emits under the
#: slot's current generation (the address and the snapshot already ride the
#: record inside ``meta``); the restore verifies the seal and mints the entry's
#: attestation back into the sidecar.
ORIGIN_PROOF_KEY = "origin_proof"

#: Field of the durable record naming the durable WRITE it belongs to: the nonce
#: the slot minted for that write (``_ChatSlot.begin_durable_queue_write``),
#: bound into every seal of the write and committed to the fenced store
#: (:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.queue_generation_store`) around the line's own
#: commit: staged as pending before the line is written, committed after. One
#: value per line, and the committed one (or the pending one, a save cut short
#: between the two) -- the restore honours no seal on a line that carries two,
#: or one the store does not name. Rotated only when the
#: durable value changes: a write that re-emits an unchanged value keeps its
#: generation, because records identical to the ones on the line cannot be a
#: replay.
ORIGIN_GENERATION_KEY = "origin_generation"

#: The drain-time constraint recorded for a restored entry whose durable record
#: this gateway's last committed write did not emit as it stands -- provenance
#: that is PRESENT AND FALSE against a record the store holds for this line: a
#: seal that does not verify (rewritten words or stamps, a seal moved from
#: another record, a record kept from a superseded write), a line of two
#: generations, a record on a sealed line naming no generation or another
#: write's, and every record of a line whose generation the store holds neither
#: as committed nor as pending for the transcript (a line rolled back whole, or
#: one older than the store).
#: Not the absence of a seal on a record that names the committed write -- that
#: is unproven prose -- not a line with no seal or generation at all for a slot
#: with no committed generation, which was written before records carried one,
#: and not a line the store holds NO record for, which is
#: :data:`UNRECORDED_GENERATION_CONSTRAINT` (see :func:`restore_queue_provenance`).
#: Named like the ``session_control`` constraints so the audit row and the notice
#: read the same; the entry is dropped at the drain with the dashboard notice,
#: and the entry's own stamps are not trusted to name anyone else.
REJECTED_SEAL_CONSTRAINT = "seal_rejected"

#: The drain-time constraint recorded for a restored entry from a line that
#: carries a generation the fenced store holds NO record of for this transcript:
#: the store answers nothing for the slot (a line older than the store; a save
#: whose PENDING write was itself refused and which was then cut short before
#: its commit -- an ordinary cut-short save is honoured instead, under the pending
#: generation the store holds for it, see :func:`restore_queue_provenance` and
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.queue_generation_store`), or names ANOTHER
#: incarnation of the transcript (``STALE_INCARNATION``: a transcript put back
#: from a copy after its slot key was reused, or a new transcript under a key
#: whose old one was removed by a path that ran no tombstone). Nothing on such a
#: line was altered -- the gateway simply never committed the write it came from
#: for THIS transcript -- so it is not :data:`REJECTED_SEAL_CONSTRAINT`'s tamper
#: reading, and the notice must not claim one; but it is nothing to honour
#: either (the seals verify under a write this gateway did not commit for it),
#: so every entry on it is dropped at the drain with the dashboard notice, its
#: stamps stripped, exactly as fail-closed as a rejection and logged as the
#: expected state it is.
UNRECORDED_GENERATION_CONSTRAINT = "generation_unrecorded"

#: Per-slot bound on the provenance store (the attestation sidecar and the
#: rejected-seal set together): only entries inside the DURABLE WINDOW -- the first
#: :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES` durable entries in queue order -- and the
#: entries a restore handed back (at most that many again: the reader's cap) hold
#: a proof or a rejection. The bound is the mechanism, not a budget: a live
#: entry's attestation is consulted by exactly one reader, the durable writer,
#: which persists the queue head up to that count and no further, and a restored
#: entry's attestation or rejection is consulted at the drain, where the restored
#: queue is already capped to the same count by the reader. A proof for a live
#: entry beyond the window is one no writer will ever seal, so the store has ONE
#: writer, :func:`_record_provenance`, which prunes both sidecars to the window it
#: is given before it records anything -- the queue's own order at a stamp, the
#: restored entries at a restore -- and the queue's drain and remove forget the
#: leaving entry at once (:func:`forget_provenance`). A queue that outgrows the
#: window (a busy slot's follow-ups keep arriving; the queue itself has no count
#: cap) therefore grows the store by nothing, whichever path writes it. The proof
#: set FOLLOWS the window rather than the order entries arrived in: a tail entry
#: is not stamped when it arrives (live, its authority comes from its flags, not
#: its proof), and the save attests it the moment the head has drained it into
#: the window, before the snapshot (:func:`reattest_durable_window`, run by
#: ``_ChatSlot.begin_durable_queue_write``) -- so the newly durable entry is
#: written sealed and restores as what it was queued as, never as unproven prose
#: that containment then drops with nobody to tell. A restored entry's proof is
#: not re-mintable by this process (its fields came off the line and were proven
#: by the seal, once), so it is kept for as long as the entry is queued, even
#: pushed past the window by a promote; a restored entry the reader left unproven
#: stays so.

    On-disk metadata is a trust boundary (the file can be edited or corrupted
    outside the gateway), so every field is re-checked instead of trusted, and
    anything the durable writer never emits is dropped rather than carried: a
    restored entry must not arrive wearing a ``kind``, a ``payload``, or a
    callback key, because each of those changes what the drain DOES with it.

    Provenance is dropped for the same reason and matters most:
    ``_directive_user_origin``, ``_directive_channel_origin`` and the entry's
    ``meta`` turn actor are never restored, so a restored entry is non-directive
    and actor-less by construction. The drain
    reduces the consumed entries' flags into the authenticated-human authority a
    directive is admitted under, and this line is an ordinary writable file — a
    carried flag would be authority granted to whoever edited it. The writer does
    not emit them either (:data:`_DURABLE_QUEUE_KEYS`); dropping them here is the
    reader's half of the same rule, so a hand-added flag buys nothing.

    This reader is PURE and is the fail-closed half of a two-step restore: it
    strips every provenance key, and :func:`restore_queue_provenance` -- given
    the owner, whose key the seal is bound to -- puts back exactly the two the
    gateway's own record seal (:data:`ORIGIN_PROOF_KEY`, the record's own field,
    with the write's :data:`ORIGIN_GENERATION_KEY` beside it) verifies over: the
    admission snapshot and the channel address. A caller that stops after this
    step restores every entry as unproven prose with no admission and no address,
    the same fail-closed reading.

    One entry per id. The writer never emits an id twice, and every queue
    mutation the user can reach (promote, edit, delete) and the drain's own drop
    are keyed by id, so a line carrying one record twice is an edited line whose
    second copy would make those mutations address the wrong entry -- and would
    run the one prompt twice. The first record under an id is the entry; a later
    one is not restored, and is counted in the warning below.

    ``meta``'s admission-time containment snapshot is stripped here because the
    asymmetry is sharp. The drain's re-check
    (``newly_held_constraints``) treats a constraint the entry recorded as
    already-held as "not a change", so an ABSENT snapshot fails closed against
    every currently-held constraint while a FORGED all-True one reports nothing
    newly held and fails OPEN — a hand-written entry would drain into a linked or
    mirrored slot and republish to an audience its admission never contemplated.
    Stripping the key restores the fail-closed baseline: the entry is re-checked
    against the constraints that hold NOW, the only set this process can vouch
    for -- unless the second step proves the snapshot is the one this gateway
    recorded. The rest of ``meta`` rides along, because it carries the sender's
    own plumbing (``sendId``, attachments) that decides nothing about audience.

    Capped at :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES` entries and
    :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_BYTES` of serialized content, the SAME two ceilings
    the persist path admits, costed against the SAME key projection — because the
    writer's bounds only bound what this gateway wrote, and the line it reads back
    can have been edited or corrupted to carry more. Whatever is admitted here is
    retained in the live slot, re-projected to every websocket client and
    re-serialized by every later save, so an unbounded read would let one
    hand-edited line cost the process memory and work forever, not just once at
    parse time. An entry that does not fit is dropped whole: a truncated prompt
    handed back as the user's own words is worse than one reported as not
    carried.

    A third ceiling, :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_SCAN`, bounds how much of the raw
    value is INSPECTED at all: the caller that applies a restored session runs on
    the event loop, so walking every entry of an arbitrarily long list — even to
    reject it — is startup work that blocks chat and the heartbeat.

            # sub-agent -- and the drain turns that into what the turn is allowed
            # to do: `model.route` admits only an actor of `user`, so an entry
            # whose stamp a file editor removed drains as the person's and gets an
            # owner-scoped model decision spent on an app's prompt. Restored, the
            # stamp is worth exactly what the file is worth, so it is dropped and
            # the drain re-derives what it can from the entry's `kind`, which the
            # writer never emits either. A restored app entry therefore carries no
            # actor at all -- the same fail-closed baseline the flags above get.

            # The SENDING SLOT goes with them, and it is the sharpest of the
            # first three because the value is not merely read, it names a WRITE
            # TARGET: the drain resolves the recipient of its drop notice from
            # this key alone and appends the entry's own text there
            # (`session_control.notify_send_origin_dropped`). Carried back off
            # the line verbatim, an edited stamp turns a file write into a
            # transcript row in a session the editor does not own, with the
            # entry's content as its body. Nothing in the entry can attest to
            # who sent it, so the key is worth exactly what the file is worth
            # and is dropped. The cost is one notice: a relay that outlives a
            # restart and is then dropped reports to nobody, while the RELAY
            # itself still survives -- which is what putting the stamp in
            # ``meta`` rather than a consumption callback buys, since a
            # callback-carrying entry is not persisted at all.
            #

            # drop notice would carry the entry's text there, so an edited stamp
            # would turn a file write into an outbound channel message. Unlike

    """The second half of the restore: hand back the provenance the gateway can prove.

    *entries* is what :func:`sanitize_restored_queue` admitted from *raw*, every
    provenance key stripped. *committed_generation* is the fenced store's own
    answer for *owner*'s slot and the transcript incarnation the line names
    (``queue_generation_store.read_committed_generation``, passed through
    untranslated): its record -- a
    :class:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.queue_generation_store.QueueGenerations` naming
    the generation of the durable write this gateway LAST COMMITTED for this
    transcript and/or the ones saves STAGED before writing their line and have
    not committed -- None when it holds no record for the slot, or
    :data:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.queue_generation_store.STALE_INCARNATION` when
    its record is for another incarnation of the transcript. For each entry, the
    durable record it came from is read again by id and its record seal
    (:data:`ORIGIN_PROOF_KEY`) recomputed over the ENTRY it is attached to -- the
    entry's id and content as restored -- plus the record's own channel address,
    admission snapshot and generation, under *owner*'s key. A seal that verifies
    puts exactly those two mappings back on the entry's ``meta`` and mints the
    entry's attestation into the owner's sidecar, BEFORE the drain re-validates
    anything: the entry then drains under the containment it was accepted with,
    and a channel hand-off is released when its binding is gone and its
    conversation told, exactly as if the process had never restarted.

    A seal is good for one entry in one durable record of the write this gateway
    committed last. One write emits every record under one
    :data:`ORIGIN_GENERATION_KEY` -- sealed or not -- and commits that generation
    to the fenced store around the line's own commit (staged as pending before
    the line is written, committed after), so the line is HONOURED only when its
    one generation IS the committed one -- or ONE OF THE PENDING ones: a save that
    died between writing the line and committing its generation left exactly
    that, the store naming the line's generation as pending, and so did a save
    whose commit was refused after its line landed, whose retry then staged its
    own generation beside it before writing (the store carries every generation
    staged since the last commit, so the retry's stage does not drop the one the
    line on disk names); the line is honoured
    with its commit OWED (the answer returned, so the caller leaves the queue owed
    and the next flush pass re-saves and commits it). Told against a committed
    record, a line that names another is one this gateway did not write last:
    kept from an older write of this slot -- whose entries the gateway has since
    consumed or released -- and put back WHOLE, so that every seal on it still
    verifies under its own generation (the rollback the store exists to refuse);
    a line carrying two generations, an older record slipped in beside the
    current ones; a line whose records name no generation while the store holds
    one, a line older than the store. Every record on such a line is REJECTED --
    recorded in the owner's rejected-seal sidecar for the drain, which drops it
    with the dashboard notice (:data:`REJECTED_SEAL_CONSTRAINT`) whatever
    constraints hold, telling nobody its stamps name. So is, on an honoured line,
    a record whose seal does not verify: content, address or snapshot rewritten
    under it, a seal copied from another record or slot, a record re-labelled
    with another generation, a record naming no generation or another write's.

    The third outcome is a line that carries a generation while the store holds
    NO record for this transcript -- none at all (a line older than the store; a
    save whose pending write was itself refused and which then died before its
    commit) or one for another incarnation of it (a transcript put back from a
    copy after its slot key was reused; a new transcript under a key whose old
    one was removed by a path that ran no tombstone). Nothing on that line
    verified false: the seals hold under a write this gateway never committed for
    this transcript, so there is nothing to honour and every record on it is
    UNRECORDED -- the owner's unrecorded-write sidecar, dropped at the drain with
    the dashboard notice exactly as a rejection is
    (:data:`UNRECORDED_GENERATION_CONSTRAINT`), but under a notice that names the
    expected state rather than a tamper, and logged once as such.

    Two other readings are NOT rejections, and neither is proof. An unsealed
    record that names the line's generation is what the writer emits for an entry
    it held no attestation for (channel text it could not place, a stamp it could
    not serialize): it keeps the stripped reading and fails closed against the
    constraints that hold now, as unproven prose. And a line on which NO record
    carries a seal or a generation, for a slot the store holds NO record for --
    none, or one for another incarnation -- was written before records carried
    one, by a gateway that sealed nothing: it proves nothing either, so every
    entry on it is the same unproven prose -- the narrower authority, re-checked
    fail-closed, its command word gone -- and, having no conversation on it, is
    not a channel message (the drain reads that off the stamp,
    ``session_control.channel_recipient_of``). The line is an agent-writable file,
    so a line stripped of every seal and generation cannot buy more than one that
    never had them. The turn actor and the sender stamp are not signed and stay
    stripped.

    Writes the sidecars through the store's one writer
    (:func:`_record_provenance`), with the restored entries as the window.
    Bounded by the same scan ceiling as the reader. Never raises: a record that
    cannot be found, read or verified simply proves nothing.

    the agent then receives text without that path and never gets the file, so
    a list still naming it would make the drained row show a card for an
    attachment that was never delivered. Each list is filtered in place to the
    entries the edit did not remove (order kept; a list left empty is removed),
    and the surviving markers in the text are renumbered to the filtered list's
    positions. The renumbering is what keeps a spaced path lossless: the
    renderer reads ``files[N-1]`` for marker ``N`` and, when the two disagree,
    falls back to a whitespace-bounded capture of the marker text -- which
    would hand back ``/tmp/My`` for ``/tmp/My Report.pdf``.

    "Removed by the edit" means the exact numbered marker was in *previous*
    (the entry's text before this edit) and is not in *content*. An entry the
    previous text never named is out of the edit's reach and is kept as-is: a
    send can carry a list entry with no marker (a caller that stamps
    ``meta.files`` on markerless text; a path the list redacted while the text
    kept it verbatim, so the two spellings differ), and the edit did not take
    that attachment away from the agent -- dropping it would make the drained
    row lose an attachment the user never touched. Returns the content to
    store; it equals *content* whenever nothing was pruned.
