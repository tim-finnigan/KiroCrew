# One gateway-wide cache shared by all THREE status emitters — the WebSocket
# status pusher (``ws._status_frame``), ``/api/status`` (``handlers_system``),
# and the SSE ``dashboard`` event (``handlers/updates``). Each of those emits
# ``status_snapshot``, whose lesson/cron defaults compute INLINE on the event
# loop (JSONL ``stat``/``read_text`` plus a SQLite ``COUNT(*)`` under the vector
# store's shared connection lock, and a ``crons.json`` parse). Running that on
# the loop is exactly the freeze class ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` guards
# against. Housing the cache here — instead of one per emitter — keeps the
# emitters from becoming INDEPENDENT contenders on that single sqlite lock: a
# per-caller cache would let each of the WS pusher, an ``/api/status`` poll, and
# every open SSE tab touch the store on its own schedule, so a busy-timeout read
# holding ``_db_lock`` for seconds would block loop-thread readers
# (``get_semantic_context`` et al.) uninstrumented. One cache, one refresh per
# TTL, however many emitters and sockets are live.

    """Return ``(cron_count, lesson_count, error)`` loaded OFF the event loop.

    ``DashboardState._count_lessons()`` performs blocking I/O on two stores:
    the JSONL file (``stat()`` + ``read_text()`` via ``load_all``) PLUS a
    SQLite ``COUNT(*)`` via ``VectorMemoryStore.count_lessons`` (serialized on
    the shared connection through ``_fetch_all_locked``, documented as
    executor-thread safe). The cron count comes from a direct read-only parse
    of ``crons.json`` (``count_enabled_from_disk``). The WS status pusher runs
    on the event loop, so computing these inline would stall the loop — and
    with it EVERY other WebSocket / coroutine on the gateway — for the
    duration of that disk latency (seconds on a slow/large home dir or a
    contended NFS mount). Offload both to a worker thread so the loop stays
    responsive; the pusher is a periodic background task, so the extra thread
    hop is free.

    The lesson count MUST come from ``_count_lessons`` (JSONL + vector store),
    the same total ``/api/status`` and the SSE updates path report via
    ``status_snapshot``'s default. Counting only ``lessons.load_all()`` here
    would let the pusher's cached value override the correct default with
    the JSONL-only half, so the Overview card would show 0 on hosts whose
    lessons live in the vector store.

    Each count is guarded INDEPENDENTLY: on failure that component falls back
    to its ``fallback`` half while the other keeps its fresh value — the
    vector-store read can surface ``sqlite3.OperationalError`` (busy timeout,
    disk I/O) or ``RuntimeError`` (store not initialized), and an exception
    escaping into ``_push_status``'s loop would silently end that connection's
    status frames, losing the version/liveness signal until a page reload. A
    lessons failure must not also discard a successfully-read cron count.
    ``None`` means UNKNOWN, never 0: the pusher seeds its cache with ``None``
    so a component that has never refreshed successfully is published as
    ``null`` (the dashboard renders a loading skeleton) instead of an
    authoritative-looking 0. ``error``
    joins each failed component's exception TYPE name (``None`` on full
    success) so the operator-visible warning can name the cause without
    leaking store paths (``str(OSError)`` embeds its filename); it never
    enters the WS frame. The guards catch ``Exception`` only, so
    ``asyncio.CancelledError`` (a ``BaseException``) propagates out of THIS
    helper uncaught — that is this function's contract; the pusher's own
    outer handler decides its task's teardown semantics.

    NOTE: this deliberately uses ``count_enabled_from_disk`` rather than
    ``list_jobs``. ``list_jobs`` is cache-only: it returns the in-memory
    snapshot the loop-side timer refreshes, so a count taken from it lags a
    write made by another process (the CLI or an MCP tool) by up to a timer
    tick, and it is documented as a loop-side call. ``count_enabled_from_disk``
    parses ``crons.json`` directly, never mutates loop-owned state or the timer,
    and so is the read that is both current across processes and safe from a
    worker thread.
