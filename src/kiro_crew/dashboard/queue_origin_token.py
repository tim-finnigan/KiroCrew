"""The queue's provenance proof: minted by the gateway, verified at the restore and the drain.

A queued prompt persisted to the session's metadata line is an ordinary writable
file. Whatever provenance the line carries is worth what the file is worth, so a
RESTORED entry has none by default: no command authority (it drains as channel
text), no admission snapshot (it is re-checked against every constraint that
holds now) and no channel address (a released binding neither drops nor reports
it) -- unless the gateway can prove it accepted the entry with exactly that
provenance. This module is that proof, in two shapes under two keys, each
derived (domain-separated) from the fenced ``token_signing.key`` secret that
also signs dashboard tokens:

* the ATTESTATION (:func:`queue_provenance_proof`) is the in-process record that
  the gateway accepted an entry with exactly its stamps: an HMAC-SHA256 over the
  slot key, the queue id, the content, the channel conversation the entry came
  from (none for dashboard text) and the containment snapshot recorded at
  admission. It lives in the slot's sidecar and is what the drain consults;
* the RECORD SEAL (:func:`queue_record_seal`) is what the durable writer stamps
  on ONE record of ONE durable write: the same fields plus the write's
  GENERATION, a nonce the slot mints whenever the durable value changes. A seal
  therefore names the entry it is on (id and content), the slot, the stamps it
  certifies and the write it belongs to. Nothing an editor can write to the file
  produces a valid one: rewritten words, a rewritten or hand-added address or
  snapshot, a seal moved onto another record or another slot, a hand-written
  tag -- and a record lifted whole from an OLDER write, whose generation is not
  the one the current line carries, verifies as nothing too. That last case is
  the replay the generation exists to refuse: a hand-off consumed before the
  restart cannot be put back on the line and run again with its authority.

The attestation lives BESIDE the queue, never on the entry (see
``slot_queue_repository``): the live entry dict is exactly what the caller
enqueued and the board never sees a tag. The seal rides the durable record as
its own field, with the generation beside it, for the restore path to verify
and read back -- minting a fresh attestation for the entry it proves.

This module's path carries ``token`` on purpose: the argv floor's credential-mint
rule denies an inline program that imports a product module named for the token
mint, which is the convention ``test_argv_floor_inline_and_brace_scope`` derives
from the tree -- every function that can produce a credential from the signing
key must sit behind a module path or a name that rule reads. Consumers import
this MODULE and call through it rather than re-exporting the producer names
under a path the gate does not cover.
