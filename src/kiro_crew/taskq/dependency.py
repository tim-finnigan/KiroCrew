"""Dependency signals and the per-scope retry coordinator.

An external dependency -- the GitHub API, an HTTP host, a model provider -- can
refuse work for a while. Without a coordinator every entry point notices that on its own and
run its own retry loop, so five sessions hitting the same GitHub rate limit
produced five independent backoff timers and, when the limit lifted, five
simultaneous retries. This module replaces that with two things:

* :class:`DependencySignal` -- ONE shape every adapter translates a service
  error into. :func:`classify_exception` walks the registered adapters (GitHub,
  generic HTTP, the ACP/provider stream) and returns the first match.
* :class:`DependencyCoordinator` -- ONE retry schedule per ``dependency_scope``.
  It honours a server-supplied ``retry_at`` exactly, otherwise retries on the
  shared recovery ladder's schedule (``recovery/policy.py``: capped exponential
  backoff, equal jitter, ``agent.recovery_backoff_*``); it bounds the wait (attempts and a
  wall-clock deadline) so nothing retries forever; and when the scope's
  ``retry_at`` arrives it wakes waiters BY CAPACITY through admission -- one
  probe first, then ``wake_per_tick`` per ``wake_spacing_secs`` -- so a
  recovered dependency never replays every waiter at once. Scopes are
  independent: one outage never delays another scope's wake.

The coordinator keeps its schedule in memory and persists every entry and exit
as ``task_events`` (``dependency_wait`` / ``dependency_wake`` /
``dependency_failed``), so :meth:`DependencyCoordinator.rebuild` reconstructs
the schedule after a gateway restart from the rows alone.

Two threads reach it, which is why the schedule lock and the store writes are
kept apart (see :class:`DependencyCoordinator`): :meth:`report` and :meth:`tick`
run on the task store's writer thread, while the gateway loop reads and edits
the same schedule (``forget``, ``recovered``, ``waiters``, ``next_deadline``,
``shared_retry_at``).

    returns the current effective admission capacity and is consulted on each
    wake tick when ``wake_per_tick`` is 0. ``on_wake`` is called once per woken
    task after its row is ``queued`` again, so the dispatcher's pump can be
    armed; a wake never bypasses admission -- the row is merely eligible.
    ``clock`` and ``rng`` are injectable for deterministic tests.

    ``wake_through`` is the run loop's seam: asked ``(task_id, generation)``
    BEFORE the coordinator writes a wake. A ``True`` answer means the waiter is
    a LIVE run that yielded its lane slot and will re-enter through admission
    (which writes ``wake_wait`` under the run's own generation when the slot
    is granted); the coordinator then records the ``dependency_wake`` event
    only, so one wake is one store write. ``False`` (or no seam) keeps the
    parked-row path: the coordinator wakes the row itself. ``on_fail`` is told
    ``(task_id, reason)`` for every waiter a scope deadline or attempts cap
    fails from :meth:`tick` or :meth:`report`, so a run blocked on its wake can
    end instead of waiting for a grant that will never come.

    ``_lock`` covers the in-memory schedule ONLY and is never held across a store
    write: one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` waits up to ``TaskStore.BUSY_TIMEOUT_SECS`` for
    a competing writer, and a batch of them under the lock would stall the loop
    for that many timeouts with nothing in ``store.loop_thread_calls`` to show it
    (the loop thread never reaches the store here). Each write therefore takes a
    :class:`ScopeInstant` snapshot under the lock and runs outside it, the same
    separation ``TaskStore._executor_lock`` keeps between the executor slot and
    the connection lock, and the same order :meth:`_terminal` and :meth:`rebuild`
    already use. The wake / give-up hooks set loop-affine
