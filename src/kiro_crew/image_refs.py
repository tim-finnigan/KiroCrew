"""Local image references in text: the path grammar, and history scrubbing.

A LEAF module, for the same reason :mod:`kiro_crew.imaging` is one: two callers
need this and only one of them may import the ACP package.

* :func:`~kiro_crew.acp.prompt_blocks.build_prompt_blocks` turns a path in the
  CURRENT request into a real image block, and reads the grammar below to find
  one.
* :func:`strip_image_refs` neutralizes a reference in REPLAYED history, and is
  called from ``kiro_crew.context`` -- application code, which the
  agent-sdk-boundary gate forbids from importing ``kiro_crew.acp`` at all
  (``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py``; there is deliberately no inline
  opt-out).

Keeping one grammar for both matters more than which module hosts it: the
scrubber's whole guarantee is stated against what the builder would inline, so a
second copy of the pattern would be a path one of them leaves for the other.
``prompt_blocks`` re-exports the names it and its tests already use.

IMPORT RULE, and it is load-bearing rather than stylistic: module scope reaches
nothing that reaches ``kiro_crew.acp``. ``prompt_blocks`` imports this module at
ITS module scope, so anything imported here that leads back to the ACP package
closes a cycle -- and it closes silently, because the order that breaks is the
one where this module is FIRST into the cluster, which no test importing
``prompt_blocks`` or ``context`` ever exercises. ``kiro_crew.messaging`` is
exactly such a path: its ``__init__`` pulls ``driver`` -> ``acp.types`` ->
``acp/__init__`` -> ``acp.client`` -> ``prompt_blocks`` -> back into this module
half-built, raising ``ImportError`` on ``_PATH_RE``. So the two scanners that
live under ``kiro_crew.messaging`` are imported where they are USED, and
``test_replay_image_refs`` pins a cold ``import kiro_crew.image_refs`` in a
subprocess so the rule cannot regress unnoticed. ``kiro_crew.widget_parse``
reaches no ACP module and stays at module scope.

# Absolute paths ending in a supported raster suffix.
#
# Two properties are load-bearing, and BOTH were learned from real defects:
#
# 1. The quantifier is non-greedy. A greedy `+` swallows the separator between
#    two paths, so "/tmp/a.png and /tmp/b.png" matched as ONE span ending at the
#    final ".png" -- not a file, so every image in a multi-image message was
#    dropped.
#
# 2. The character class holds HORIZONTAL whitespace only, and a lookbehind
#    forbids starting inside a URL or another path. With `\s` (which includes
#    "\n") a leading URL chained across the newline into the appended path:
#    `slack/events.py` emits "<user text>\n<image path>", so
#
#        see https://example.com/docs\n/tmp/a.png
#
#    matched as "//example.com/docs\n/tmp/a.png" -- one nonexistent path. Any
#    Slack message containing a link therefore lost its image. The `(?<![\w:/])`
#    guard rejects the "/" inside "https://" as a start position, which also
#    stops a URL that merely ends in ".png" from being probed as a local file.

    """*text* with every local image reference replaced by a content-free marker.

    The inverse of :func:`~kiro_crew.acp.prompt_blocks.build_prompt_blocks`, for
    text that is replayed or recalled HISTORY rather than the current request: a
    history row names a picture that belonged to an earlier turn, and the two
    ways that reference can be read are both wrong (see
    :data:`STRIPPED_IMAGE_MARKER`). Replacing it with a marker is the "fully
    removed" half of the only two honest options, since a text vehicle cannot
    carry bytes.

    Both shapes a row can hold are covered, in the order that keeps them from
    overlapping: markdown ``![alt](dest)`` first, via the same
    :func:`~kiro_crew.messaging.outbound_files.iter_local_refs` scan the
    attachment store uses -- which is what the dashboard persists -- and then
    bare paths, which is what a Slack or Telegram inbound message appends.
    Doing markdown first means the second pass never sees a destination that
    was already inside a link.

    The bare-path pass is ``_PATH_RE`` -- the same pattern the builder reads, so
    the two cannot drift into a path this function leaves behind for that one to
    pick up -- narrowed by conditions the builder does not need, because its
    rewrite happens only after a file was actually read while a substitution has
    no such condition:

    * code is masked (:func:`_mask_code_spans`), so a fenced or inline-code
      path is documentation and stays readable;
    * the path must stand alone (:data:`_STANDALONE_LEAD_RE`), so a path inside
      a URL query is left as part of its URL.

    Those two are corruption when rewritten, which is strictly worse than the
    residue of not rewriting them: a URL-embedded path naming a file that still
    exists can still be inlined out of a replayed row, exactly as it would be
    out of the current turn's text without this function. Narrowing here does
    not change that behaviour in either direction.

    One more shape is read conservatively, because the grammar cannot settle it
    and the scrubber has no file to ask. A span holding a space or tab may be a
    spaced file name (``Screen Shot 2024.png``) or a stretch of prose (``check
    /var/log/app and tell me why logo.png is broken``). Its last token is tried
    as a path on its own first, and otherwise its shape has to vouch for it
    (:func:`_spaced_span_is_one_path`: alone on its line, quoted, or a markdown
    link's destination). The residue is a spaced path written mid-sentence with
    none of those shapes, which keeps its text: settling it needs either a
    filesystem probe -- a blocking call on the event loop, and the data home
    behind it can be a network share -- or a rescan of the span's interior,
    whose own failure mode is deleting the prose this function exists to keep.

    Remote and ``data:`` references are left alone, matching
    ``iter_local_refs``: neither is a local path, so neither is inlined and a
    URL stays usable to a tool-capable agent. That agreement is enforced rather
    than assumed -- the bare-path pass calls the same ``is_remote_destination``
    predicate, because a protocol-relative ``//cdn/x.png`` is a path shape to
    BOTH grammars and only the predicate can tell a genuine URL from a stored
    UNC attachment on a roaming profile's share.

    Two residues remain, both inherited and both narrower than the builder's own
    behaviour rather than wider. ``_PATH_RE`` is platform-gated, so a bare
    Windows path in a transcript transferred to a POSIX host is not matched --
    it is not inlined there either, and the markdown shape is matched on both
    hosts. And escaped ``\\![x](...)`` markup and 4-space-indented code are not
    treated as code here, so a genuine absolute path inside one is replaced by
    the marker; the builder rewrites those same spans to ``[image: <name>]``
    whenever the file is readable, so this is that established rewrite extended
    to the unreadable case, on a per-build copy, with the on-disk row untouched.

    Reads no files and mutates nothing: it returns a new string. Every rule
    above is lexical, so a history build makes no filesystem call at all. That
    matters because this runs inline on the event loop, while the builder's
    own probes are deliberately offloaded (``acp.client`` runs it through
    ``asyncio.to_thread``): resolving the data home here would put a
    ``Path.resolve()`` on a user-set ``KIROCREW_HOME`` -- a network share on a
    roaming profile -- in front of every history row.
