    Used by :func:`_restart` when no platform service is active. The
    new process:

    - Detaches via ``start_new_session=True`` (own session + process
      group), so closing the calling terminal does not SIGHUP it.
    - Drops stdin to ``/dev/null`` and redirects stdout/stderr to
      ``~/.kiro/crew/gateway.log`` (same file the existing ``logs``
      command tails for foreground gateways), so the user has one
      place to look regardless of how the gateway was started.
    - Resolves the console script this CLI was invoked as
      (:func:`_own_console_script`) first, so a restart respawns the
      *same* ``kirocrew`` rather than whichever one happens to sit
      earliest on ``PATH``; then ``shutil.which("kirocrew")``, falling
      back to ``sys.executable -m kiro_crew`` so editable/source-tree
      dev installs also work without a global ``kirocrew`` symlink.
    - Closes all inherited file descriptors so it does not pin sockets
      or pipes from the parent CLI process.
    - Binds *port* when given (``--port N``).

    Passing *port* is what keeps a restart coherent. The caller has already
    resolved a port, stopped the gateway on it, and will poll *that* port for
    readiness — but the child re-resolves independently, and its resolution
    order has no access to the parent's. Once ``resolve_client_port`` can
    discover a port from a run-marker (or once the marker is cleared by the
    stop we just performed), parent and child can disagree: the replacement
    would bind 5476 while the parent polls 6776 and prints a 6776 URL. Naming
    the port explicitly removes the disagreement by construction.

    Returns the ``Popen`` handle, not just the pid: the caller must be able to
    ask whether the replacement is still alive before it reports success, and
    only the handle yields the child's **exit status** when it is not. A
    replacement refused by the ``KIROCREW_HOME`` ownership guard exits 1 within
    milliseconds, and that status is the whole diagnosis.

    A bare port probe cannot tell a replacement from the incumbent — the old
    gateway keeps answering until its socket closes, so a 200 taken during the
    handover would report success for the process we just asked to die. The
    discriminator is the run-marker pid: every dashboard-serving gateway records
    its own pid in ``run/gateway-<port>.pid`` while wiring the dashboard, i.e.
    *before* it publishes readiness, so a ready gateway's marker always names the
    process that is serving. Waiting for that identity to CHANGE (rather than for
    any 200) mirrors the ``_gateway_start_id`` handshake in the dev-fleet app.

    On POSIX with a working listener lookup the marker claim is additionally
    checked against reality via :func:`_gateway_owns_port` (recorded pid holds
    the port, owned by us, looks like a gateway). That check denies outright on
    Windows — and on any POSIX host without ``lsof``/``netstat`` it cannot
    succeed either — so it is only applied where it can pass; elsewhere the
    marker comparison alone stands, which keeps restart from reporting a false
    failure on those hosts.

    **No marker means not proven, never proven.** An absent marker is the state
    the handover itself produces: ``clear_marker`` runs on graceful shutdown
    BEFORE the outgoing gateway's ``_shutdown()``, so there is a window in which
    the old gateway has erased its marker and its socket still answers. Treating
    that as "the replacement is serving" would report the outgoing gateway's 200
    as the new one's — precisely the confusion this function exists to prevent —
    and on a host without a listener lookup nothing downstream would catch it.
    So an unreadable marker returns ``False``: the caller keeps polling until a
    marker appears or the deadline passes. The cost is a gateway whose marker
    write failed (the write is best-effort, wrapped in ``except Exception``)
    being reported as "not ready" while it is in fact serving. That is the right
    way to be wrong here — a misleading timeout leaves a working gateway and an

    Two details earn their keep:

    * **Early death short-circuits the wait.** A replacement refused by the
      ``KIROCREW_HOME`` ownership guard exits within milliseconds; polling the
      port for the full timeout would turn a instantly-knowable failure into a
      15s stall with a worse message. ``proc.poll()`` is used rather than a pid
      liveness probe because we are the child's parent, so it both detects the
      exit and yields the status the operator needs. (Same shape as ``pod``'s
      ``_wait_healthy`` bailing out on a dead unit instead of burning the wait.)
    * **A zero timeout still probes once.** The deadline is checked *after* the
      probe, so a collapsed timeout reports what is actually there instead of a
      reflexive failure.
    * **The child is re-polled before the timeout verdict.** A replacement that
      exits DURING the last probe would otherwise be reported as "still running

      prompt in setup to guard itself with an isatty check.
