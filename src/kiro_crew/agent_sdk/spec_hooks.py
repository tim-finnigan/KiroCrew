"""Run an agent spec's own ``hooks`` from Crew's turn loop, for a harness that cannot.

kiro-cli reads the spec off disk and runs its ``hooks`` itself. KAS takes the agent
over the wire as ``_meta.kiro.customAgents``, whose schema has no slot for them
(``acp.kas_agents.UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_KEYS``), so on KAS nothing runs them. The backends
in ``ACP_BACKENDS_CREW_FIRES_SPEC_HOOKS`` get them from Crew instead: the turn loop
already fires the five Crew hook events for every backend, and this module turns the
spec's field into :class:`kiro_crew.hooks.ScriptHook` records that ride the same
``ScriptHookStore.fire`` call. So a spec hook meets exactly the gates a Hooks-page
hook meets -- ``capabilities.script_hooks`` and its SEL audit, the sandboxed spawn,
the timeout, the PreToolUse fail-closed rule -- and none that a Hooks-page hook does
not.

Membership is the whole double-fire guard. A non-member's harness runs the field
itself, so the turn loop asks :func:`spec_script_hooks` only when the session's
capabilities say Crew owns the job.

Both spec shapes are read:

* the object form kiro-cli uses and Crew materializes, ``{event: [{command,
  matcher?, timeout_ms?}]}`` on the five camelCase event names;
* the array of KAS hook documents, validated by
  :func:`kiro_crew.agent.normalize_spec_hooks`. ``enabled: false`` is skipped, and
  so is ``confirm: true``, because no prompt can be shown from here; an ``agent``
  action and a trigger with no Crew event are skipped too.

A tool matcher is written in kiro-cli's tool names (``execute_bash``, ``fs_write``),
and KAS names its tools differently. On a PreToolUse permission request the turn
loop therefore matches these hooks against
:func:`spec_hook_tool_names` of the id KAS states for the call, not against the
call's title; a call KAS names no tool for is matched on
its title, as a Hooks-page hook is. A PostToolUse still sees the
title, because KAS's tool-call frames carry no tool id. A PreToolUse matcher the
table does not know is kept, matched against KAS's id as written, and warned about
once.

The result is cached by the field's content, so a spec that stays the same costs
one conversion and logs its warnings once, not once per turn.

The turn loop is not the only place a tool runs: a subagent run and a task-runner
step fire the same hook store for their own tool calls. :func:`turn_spec_hooks`
answers for those, keyed on the SUBAGENT's agent and its own provider, so a kiro-cli
subagent under a KAS parent still gets nothing from Crew.
