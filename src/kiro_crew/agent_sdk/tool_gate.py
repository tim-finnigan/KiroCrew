"""Whether a harness's tool decisions reach Kiro Crew's PreToolUse gate.

One place resolves the verdict, so the refusal message, the doctor row and any
future dashboard surface cannot disagree about why a session was allowed.

The gate itself -- the bundled denied-command rules, the sensitive-path block,
the governance ceiling -- runs only from ``HookManager.on_tool_call``, reached
only from the permission-request branch of the dispatch parser. A harness that
does not send ``session/request_permission`` per tool call is a harness where
none of those controls execute, so "does it ask?" is a security question rather
than a compatibility one.

**A LEAF module, deliberately.** It imports the vocabulary from
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends` and nothing from ``kiro_crew.acp``, which the
SDK boundary gate treats as a forbidden root. The callers that need a verdict --
``acp/client.py`` on the session path, and later ``kirocrew doctor`` and the
dashboard -- can therefore all reach it, and a consumer naming a verdict does not
buy a forbidden edge to do it.

Moved here from ``kiro_crew/acp_tool_gate.py`` by RFC PR 3, which pulls the
capability mechanism inside the boundary. That top-level path survives as a pure
re-export shim, so ``acp/client.py`` still calls through it by attribute and the
tests that patch it still reach what the client calls.

**Enforcement scope.** Three mechanisms are ENFORCED here --
:data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.Routing.SESSION_CONFIG`,
:data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.Routing.VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS` and
:data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.Routing.VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION` -- because
they are the three this core implements end to end. ``AGENT_SPEC`` needs no
enforcement (it holds by construction), and ``SEEDED_SETTINGS`` is
declared-but-unenforced, and the reason is a read-back
gap rather than a missing writer. ``AcpClient._write_claude_local_settings`` does
seed ``permissions.defaultMode`` into ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json``,
but it writes only the file it OWNS -- created this session and still carrying the
bytes Crew wrote -- and declines otherwise, and nothing reads back whether the
adapter honoured the mode. A ``bypassPermissions`` already sitting in a user's own
``settings.local.json`` or ``~/.claude`` is therefore neither detected nor
stripped, so the precondition this mechanism would need is not established.
``routing_verdict`` reports that honestly as INDETERMINATE -- what is scoped is
whether a non-ROUTED verdict REFUSES, not whether it is told truthfully. Widening the scope
means implementing a mechanism, not editing an allowlist.

``VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`` is what closes that read-back gap for one harness
rather than in general: the client supplies the required setting as the session
starts, READS THE HARNESS'S OWN RESOLVED CONFIGURATION BACK, and hands the observed
value to :func:`seeded_setting_issue` before the first prompt. So the two members
are not the same mechanism at different confidence levels -- one has an observation
and the other does not, which is exactly why enforcement follows the member and not
the harness id. Reading the harness's resolution rather than the bytes Crew supplied
is also what makes a PRECEDENCE change visible: the answer is what the session will
use, not what the seed hoped it would.

#: nothing performs.
#:
#: KNOWN SEAM GAP, recorded here because this is where a reader meets it.
#: :func:`is_enforced` reads this set to answer TWO different questions: "does a
#: non-ROUTED verdict refuse this session?" and, through
#: :func:`adapter_hidden_credential_dirs`, "does this harness get the OS credential
#: mask?". Those are not the same question. The mask compensates for a harness whose
#: passive READS bypass the gate, which is a property of the harness, not of whether
#: its routing verdict is capable of refusing. They agree for every harness carried
#: today, so nothing is wrong now and nothing here is a workaround -- but a harness
#: that needs the mask while declaring a mechanism that cannot refuse would get
#: neither, and one that refuses without doing passive reads would carry a mask it
#: does not need. Splitting them is a change to a security control and belongs in its
#: own change; tracked at
#: docs/system-specs/modules/harness-onboarding.md#worked-example-the-deepseek-harness,

#:
#: Such an adapter authenticates itself, so its OWN token is the one thing the mask

#:
#: Not every enforced harness has one. A harness entitled by
#: ``host_auth.ENTITLEMENT_HOST_VAULT`` is handed its key as an environment variable
#: at spawn (the DeepSeek Harness, from ``agent.deepseek_env``), so it authenticates
#: with no readable file and declares ``()`` -- which is strictly tighter, because a
#: carve-out re-opens the leaf for the harness's whole process tree including the
#: shells it runs, while an env-fed key does not exist as a file there at all.
#: ``test_acp_tool_gate.test_every_enforced_harness_declares_its_own_credential``

#: declares that source, and one declaring that source names NO leaf.

#: PROJECTED from each harness's declaration in

#: the same file: a leaf spelled here but not there is an exclusion from a mask
#: that never covered it, and the declaration refuses to make one -- a harness may
#: only ask the mask to spare a leaf its own declaration put ON the floor.
#:
#: A harness that declares none is ABSENT rather than present with an empty tuple,
#: so the ``.get(backend, ())`` reads below are unchanged.
#:
#: Home-relative, matching the floor's own spelling. An operator override

#: Gate-artifact leaf a gate-extension harness's child must load Crew's gate from.

#: and reads its extension, the DeepSeek Harness loads its plugin through the patch --
#: while the read gate still fences the AGENT's own file tools from the leaf, so
#: excluding it from this mask separates two readers instead of weakening the floor.
#: Every child whose routing is not ``VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION`` still has the leaf
#: masked. A future secret must never be placed under ``pi-gate``; one that must live
#: there needs its own masked leaf, as ``run/voice-runtime`` does.
#:
#: Nothing the CHILD writes belongs here, and that is a property of the leaf rather
#: than an accident: it is sealed read-only against every harness child
#: (``sandbox._CREW_NOFOLLOW_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES``) so none can plant what a later
#: session loads. The DeepSeek gate's load marker is written by the child, so it lives
#: in that session's private scratch window instead -- see ``acp/client.py``.
#:
#: The name is pi's because pi was the first harness to need it, and it is kept rather

#: credentials`` -- surfaced to the operator as an opaque ``Authentication
#: required``. Re-exposing exactly this file is the cc tier's own Linux posture
#: (``_CC_EXPOSE_FILES``), applied here on BOTH platforms rather than excluding
#: the leaf: ``~/.aws/credentials`` and ``~/.aws/sso/cache`` stay hidden from a
#: child whose passive reads never reach the gate. Each backend carries the
#: primitive already -- the Linux launcher restores a 0444 copy of the file into
#: the empty bind mount, and the Seatbelt builder emits a ``require-not
#: (literal ...)`` exception on the subpath deny (the shape it uses for
#: ``.ssh/known_hosts``). The read gate still fences ``.aws`` for the agent's
#: own file tools.
#:
#: A leaf here must sit UNDER a masked directory: the mask is what makes the
#: re-exposure a narrowing rather than a no-op, and ``test_acp_tool_gate``
#: pins that containment.
#:
#: Accepted residual, carried knowingly: the AWS CLI also honours
#: ``aws_access_key_id`` / ``aws_secret_access_key`` written directly into a
#: ``[profile]`` block of ``~/.aws/config``. An operator with that layout hands
#: those static keys to the child through this carve-out, exactly as the cc
#: tier's ``_CC_EXPOSE_FILES`` already does for Claude Code. The mask cannot
#: tell a ``credential_process`` line from a key line without parsing the file,
#: and the Seatbelt carve-out exposes the real inode, so no per-line redaction
#: is possible there; the Linux copy is deliberately kept byte-identical so the
#: two platforms carry the SAME residual rather than a silent asymmetry. The
#: launcher reads the source with the plain ``open()`` the cc tier has always
#: used, so a symlink, hardlink or bind alias the OPERATOR plants at
#: ``~/.aws/config`` is followed, exactly as for Claude Code today: the child
#: cannot plant one (``~/.aws`` is bind-masked in its session and the agent's
#: file tools are fenced from it), so this is operator self-exposure of the
#: operator's own store, not a boundary the child can cross. Operators who
#: keep static keys in ``config`` should move them to ``credentials``, which
#: stays masked.
#: HOST-owned, and deliberately NOT projected from a harness declaration like the
#: exclusion above.
#:
#: The exclusion can be declared safely because the declaration constrains it: a
#: harness may only ask the mask to spare a leaf its own declaration put ON the
#: floor. A re-exposure has no such constraint available. It is an EDIT to the mask,
#: and no structural rule separates the one legitimate case from the worst
#: illegitimate one -- ``.aws/config`` and ``.ssh/id_rsa`` are both files under a
#: directory this mask hides, so "must sit under something masked" admits them
#: equally. So this stays where adding an entry is visibly a change to a security
#: control, made by the host, rather than a line in a driver's own declaration.

    DERIVED from ``security.sensitive_home_dirs()`` rather than enumerated, and

    whose passive reads never reach ``HookManager.on_tool_call``: the floor states
    what an agent may never read, so anything on it the child can still open is a
    hole in the compensation. An enumerated short list left exactly that hole --
    ``.claude/.credentials.json``, ``.netrc``, ``.git-credentials``, ``.pypirc``
    and ``.npmrc`` were all on the floor and still readable by the child, the first
    of them a leaf this very change had just classified. Deriving keeps the two in
    step, and a floor entry added later is covered with no edit here.

    The harness's own credential store is excluded WHEN it declares one, because
    such an adapter must read it to authenticate; a harness entitled from Crew's
    secret vault declares none and keeps its credential leaves masked for its whole
    process tree. A NARROW set of Crew runtime leaves is excluded for every
    backend, because an in-sandbox Crew reader needs them and they hold no credential
    -- :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.crew_host_runtime_leaves` owns that set, and the
    governance ceilings and consent records are deliberately NOT in it: they are
    inputs to an authorization decision, so they stay masked and an in-sandbox
    resolution fails closed. A gate-artifact leaf is excluded for the ONE backend
    whose child must execute Crew's launcher there, which is narrower than the set
    above on purpose: every other child's mask still covers it.

    All three asymmetries are intentional and safe: the floor still blocks the AGENT's
    file tools from each leaf, so the controls cover different readers rather than
    cancelling each other.

    ``.ssh`` arrives through the floor and it has a cost: git-over-SSH inside such
    a session stops working, because the private key is unreadable to the child.

    ABSOLUTE paths: ``sandbox.wrap_argv`` runs ``os.path.abspath`` over what it is

    nothing. File leaves are fine to pass -- the Linux launcher classifies each
    entry with its own ``isfile``/``isdir``, and the macOS profile emits both a

    The :data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.Readback.LOAD_MARKER` half of

    *marker* is the parsed JSON object the plugin wrote; *extension_path* is the

    reports; *nonce* is the per-session value Kiro Crew put in the child's
    environment. Taken as arguments rather than read here for the reason its
    sibling gives: the driver owns the process, this owns the decision.

    The identity fields and ``approval`` snapshot are required together and none
    is redundant. ``plugin`` is the probe name, so a marker some other tool happens
    to leave at the path is not this one. ``nonce`` is what a STALE marker cannot
    have -- a file left by an earlier session, or planted before the spawn, carries
    a nonce this session never issued, and without this check a gate that failed to
    load would read as loaded. ``module`` is what a DIFFERENT gate cannot have: the
    operator's own configuration can compose plugins too, and one that wrote this
    marker shape from another file would otherwise pass.

    DeepSeek's snapshot closes the other replaceable hops. ``answerers`` must be
    exactly the stock ACP bridge's root-bus listener, identified by Cordis's owning
    loader entry and plugin runtime, and the composed approval policy must be
    ``ask``. ``tools.mode`` -- the presentation the tools service actually
    composed -- must be ``native``, because under ``ptc`` or ``both`` the model
    reaches Node's own APIs through one ``run_code`` call the gate cannot read
    inside; the per-launch patch pins it, and this is what makes the pin a verified
    property rather than a bet on overlay precedence. And ``child_env`` must be a
    clean PROOF, taken on a child the plugin spawned through the harness's own
    subprocess service, that every name in *child_scrub_names* -- the
    ``agent.deepseek_env`` names whose values arrive from Crew's vault -- was
    withheld from that child: the set the plugin checked must be exactly the set
    Crew configured (a plugin that checked nothing, or something else, vouches for
    nothing), every name must have been SET in the harness's own environment
    (an unset canary observes nothing), none may have reached the child, and the
    child must have run. A missing or malformed private Cordis shape refuses rather
    than treating an unverified route as intact.

    ``agent.acp_backend_allow_ungated_tools``, a LOCAL config bool that started the
    session anyway with a warning and an audit event. That is the precise shape the
    central governance ceiling exists to forbid: a managed fleet could allow this
    harness while a standard user's own config switched the compensating control
    off, breaking POLICY-intersect-PROFILE for the calls the harness self-approves.
    A security control with a local off-switch is not a control, and such an escape
    hatch is not needed -- the refusal names the concrete
    remedy (:func:`remediation_for`), and lowering the sandbox tier remains an
    operator decision that IS clamped by the ceiling.

    A harness outside :data:`ENFORCED_ROUTINGS` returns unchanged: the verdict is
    still reported truthfully by :func:`routing_verdict`, but this core does not
    implement its mechanism and must not refuse a session over a guarantee it
    never attempted.
