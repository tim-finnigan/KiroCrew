"""How each agent backend signs in, declared once per harness.

Before this module every auth fact about a harness was an edit to a shared table
or an ``if`` chain in a host module: the credential floor spelled the token leaf,
the sandbox mask spelled the one leaf to leave readable, a membership set spelled
whether a host logout may retire a running child, and the panel spelled the
sign-in advice in thirteen locale files. Nothing in the tree was a per-harness
auth object, so a harness that brought its own sign-in was onboarded by touching
twenty-four files -- and the harness that shipped selectable first touched none
of them, which is how a live agent-readable OAuth token sat off the floor while
that harness was already selectable.

One declaration per harness, and the host layers PROJECT from it:

============================================  ================================
consumer                                      projection it reads
============================================  ================================
``security.paths`` credential floor           :func:`credential_leaves`,
                                              :func:`override_anchored_leaves`,
                                              :func:`home_override_env_vars`
``agent_sdk.tool_gate`` own-leaf exclusion    :data:`AGENT_AUTH_DECLARATIONS`
``agent_sdk.backends`` logout-recycle set     :func:`backends_retired_by_host_logout`
``acp`` auth-required message                 :func:`signed_out_message`
``doctor_checks.agents`` sign-in row          :func:`declaration_for`
``GET /api/acp-backends`` auth object         :func:`declaration_for`
============================================  ================================

The split is the security property, not a tidiness one. A driver declares WHAT IT
STORES; the host decides what is fenced. A driver that could edit the mask could
exclude its way out of it, so no field here names a path to leave open in general
-- ``adapter_own_leaves`` may only name a leaf this same declaration already put
ON the floor, and :meth:`AgentAuthDeclaration.__post_init__` refuses a
declaration that tries otherwise.

Why this module is stdlib-only
------------------------------
``security.paths`` reads this table while building the credential floor, and it
is imported very early -- which is precisely why it reads
:mod:`kiro_crew.identity_stores`, a stdlib-only leaf, rather than anything
heavier. This table has to sit on the same footing or the floor cannot read it
without closing an import cycle. So the only non-stdlib import here is
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`, itself stdlib-only, for the backend ids.
``test/test_agent_sdk_host_auth.py`` pins that: it walks this module's own
module-scope imports against an allowlist AND spawns a cold interpreter to
assert importing it pulls in no third-party module and none of
``kiro_crew.security``, ``kiro_crew.acp``, ``kiro_crew.config`` or
``kiro_crew.sandbox``.

Interactive login is the OPTIONAL half
--------------------------------------
A harness that brings its own sign-in -- Codex, Claude Code -- needs no in-product
login flow, and :class:`AgentInteractiveLogin` is how that absence stays visible.
It is a ``runtime_checkable`` protocol tested with ``isinstance``, never a
boolean field, so a driver that does not implement it is a shape the type system
can see rather than one that answers a flag and then no-ops.

# logout policy all branch on this, and a typo'd spelling would read as a
# harness nobody has an answer for instead of failing the parity test.

#: Signed in through the HOST's own identity store -- the one ``kiro-cli login``
#: writes. A logout there invalidates a running child, which is what makes
#: ``host_logout_retires_children`` true for these harnesses and only these.
ENTITLEMENT_HOST_IDENTITY_STORE = "host_identity_store"

#: Signed in through the harness's OWN credential file, which it writes and reads
#: itself. Kiro Crew never reads it and only ever checks that it exists.
ENTITLEMENT_OWN_CREDENTIAL_FILE = "own_credential_file"

#: Entitled by a key Kiro Crew holds in ITS OWN secret vault and hands to the
#: harness's process as an environment variable at spawn.
#:
#: The third source, and it is what lets a harness be enforced with NO carve-out in
#: :attr:`AgentAuthDeclaration.adapter_own_leaves`: the key never has to be readable
#: as a file inside the child's tree, so the credential leaves stay masked for the
#: whole process tree instead of being spared for it. Only usable by a harness that
#: (a) resolves a provider credential from its inherited environment and (b) keeps
#: that class of variable away from the shells it spawns itself -- both properties of
#: the harness, verified against it rather than assumed, which is why this is a
#: declared source and not a flag any driver may set.
ENTITLEMENT_HOST_VAULT = "host_vault"

# Three sources, because three are constructed. A harness whose entitlement arrives
# from the ambient cloud environment (an AWS profile, an instance role) rather than
# from a file it owns or from Crew's vault would add a fourth here, with its label,
# when it exists.

#: Entitlement source -> what to call it in front of an operator.
#:
#: The identifiers above are code, and doctor printed them raw: a triage row read
#: ``own_credential_file``, and the KAS token row went from "owned by kiro-cli" to
#: ``host_identity_store``. Snake_case internals in output a human is meant to read
#: is a regression whether or not the fact behind it is right, so the label lives
#: beside the identifier rather than being spelled at each print site.

    #:
    #: The sandbox mask hides the whole credential floor from an enforced

    #: subset of :attr:`credential_leaves`: excluding a leaf the declaration
    #: never put on the floor is either a no-op or an attempt to open something
    #: the host fenced for another reason.
    #:
    #: ACCEPTED RISK, stated so a reader meets it here rather than deducing it. The
    #: leaf named is the harness's OWN provider credential, and the model already
    #: holds its USE-power through the harness: every turn it takes is already spent
    #: against that credential. What the exclusion adds is the possibility of
    #: EXFILTRATION -- a shell the model spawns inside the harness can read the file
    #: and send the secret somewhere. That is a real residual risk and it is carried
    #: knowingly, because the alternative is a harness that cannot sign in at all.
    #: Four harnesses carry it today -- codex, OpenCode, pi and goose -- and the
    #: maintainer weighed and accepted this exact trade rather than it being an
    #: oversight. What bounds it is the subset rule above: the exclusion can only
    #: re-open a file this same declaration put on the floor, so no harness can reach
    #: another harness's credential or anything the floor fences for a different
    #: reason.
    #:
    #: It is NOT the only shape an enforced harness can take. A harness declaring
    #: :data:`ENTITLEMENT_HOST_VAULT` is fed its key as an environment variable at
    #: spawn and declares ``()`` here, so its credential leaves stay masked for the
    #: whole process tree and the exfiltration path above does not exist for it. The
    #: DeepSeek Harness is the first enforced harness of that shape: it resolves a
    #: provider key from its inherited environment, and it scrubs every variable
    #: whose NAME matches ``/KEY|PASSWORD|SECRET|TOKEN/i`` before spawning any child
    #: of its own, so the key is invisible to the shells it runs. A harness that can
    #: be entitled that way must be, rather than carrying a carve-out it does not
    #: need.
    adapter_own_leaves: Tuple[str, ...]

    #: What an operator DOES to sign this harness in. Rendered VERBATIM.
    #:
    #: States the ACTION and never the STATE, because most of the places it
    #: appears have taken no measurement: the backend panel shows it as a standing
    #: caveat, and the doctor row prints it under an explicit "not checked here".
    #: A sentence asserting "is not signed in" in those places tells an operator
    #: who IS signed in something false, which is how a standing line trains its
    #: reader to skip it. Where the host does have evidence, it uses
    #: :attr:`signed_out_message` instead.
    #:
    #: PROSE, not terminal output. The dashboard renders this as plain text in a
    #: div, so it must read as a sentence there: an em dash rather than the ``--``
    #: this codebase writes in comments, and no markdown backticks, both of which
    #: reach the reader literally one line below sibling copy that uses a real em
    #: dash. :attr:`signed_out_message` is under no such rule -- it goes to a
    #: terminal row and to the chat error card, which render both.

    #: its final segment there -- ``CODEX_HOME`` moves ``.codex/auth.json`` to
    #: ``$CODEX_HOME/auth.json``. That is not the only shape an override has:
    #: ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` replaces the ``.local/share`` PREFIX of
    #: ``.local/share/opencode/auth.json``, so the relocated file keeps two
    #: segments and a floor anchored on the final one alone fences a path the
    #: harness never writes -- leaving the real relocated token readable.
    #:
    #: Which prefix an override replaces is knowledge the HARNESS has and the floor
    #: cannot infer, so it is declared here beside the variable that does the
    #: relocating. Same length as :attr:`credential_leaves` when given, and each

    #: missing configuration. The phrase is copied from a live capture of the
    #: harness, never guessed, because a phrase that also appears in a transient
