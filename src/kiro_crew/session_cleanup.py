"""Periodic cleanup and watchdog policy for session lifecycle management.

The :class:`SessionCleanup` service owns cleanup-loop state while the
``SessionManager`` facade remains the authority for the session registry and
all lifecycle mutations.  Calls back into the manager deliberately use the
facade's legacy method names: tests and integrations replace those methods on
individual manager instances, so late owner lookup is part of the compatibility
contract.

Dependencies whose defining names are patchable in ``kiro_crew.session`` are
injected as forwarding callables.  The facade must resolve those names when a
call is made rather than capture their values during construction.

#: tree after the prompt returns, and reports the launch on the launching tool
#: call; it reports nothing a client can read while that work runs, nor when it

#: background work -- possibly steered to by injected content -- renews it
#: forever and the time bound alone does not bound memory. Inside the hold
#: the RSS recycle therefore still proceeds once the tree exceeds this multiple
#: of the configured ceiling, and the notice names the launched work that may
#: have been stopped (only this recycle does: one let through past the hold
#: presumed the work finished, so its notice stays plain).
#: Why 2x: the reported workflow trees read 2398-2641 MB against
#: the 1536 MB default ceiling, so the hold must survive an ordinary workflow
#: at ~1.6-1.7x while still cutting off a runaway before it grows unbounded.

        Every other sweep on this tick asks a record whether a pid is still
        needed. This one asks the kernel what exists and acts on the two
        disagreements: a live process no record claims, and a record naming a
        process that is gone. It publishes both counts whether or not it acted,
        because a leak that is merely counted is still a leak an operator can see.

        The reconciler object is built once and kept on the cleanup state: the
        two-pass confirmation that stops it killing a process whose registration
        is still in flight is that object's memory of the previous pass.

        Blocking work -- ``cgroup.procs`` reads, ``/proc`` reads, the signals --
        runs on the maintenance executor, exactly like the scope reaper and for
        the same reason: these are filesystem reads over same-uid agent-writable
        paths, and doing them on the event loop parks the gateway.

        The pid union is therefore taken HERE, on the loop, and handed to the pass
        as a frozen set. It cannot be read from the worker: ``_pool_pids`` drains
        the warm pool's ``asyncio.Queue`` with ``get_nowait`` and puts every entry
        back, which is safe only on the loop that owns the queue. From a thread it
        races the refill check, and a refill that sees a momentarily empty pool
        spawns runtimes to fill one that was never empty.

        A probe that raises is a probe that cannot see the children, not a
        session with none; recycling on that answer is exactly the hazard the
        guard exists to prevent, so an error keeps the session.

        An AWAITABLE answer is awaited: the dashboard's probe reads the task
        store off the loop, and a sync probe (a double, a build with no queue)
        answers straight away.

        A PENDING COMPLETION INJECTION also counts as attached work, and is
        asked FIRST because it costs no await. The gateway increments that
        counter before awaiting the injected turn's store read, so in the window
        before ``get_or_create`` the session holds no semaphore, has no running
        child (the delivering sub-agent is already ``done``) and, with its tab
        closed, no in-flight delivery either. Every signal this guard otherwise
        reads is absent while a turn is committed to that session, and the reset
        discards the very runtime the injection is about to write into.

        That read happens BEFORE the probe below suspends, so it cannot see an
        injection that starts inside the await. It is therefore not sufficient on
        its own: a caller that resets after awaiting this wrapper re-asks
        ``_injection_pending`` immediately before the act. Every such caller does
        -- the idle sweep on both its axes and the RSS recycle.

        Fail-closed has a cost: a probe that RAISES system-wide keeps EVERY
        candidate on every path, so the idle sweep, the orphan axis and the RSS
        recycle all stop reaping until it recovers. That must be visible above
        debug, but not once per candidate per tick, so the warning is bounded
        to one per ``PROBE_FAILURE_WARN_INTERVAL_SECS`` across all keys and each
        failure keeps its traceback at debug. The warning covers only an
        exception that escapes the probe: an unreadable task store does not
        raise here, because ``subagents_attached_async`` absorbs it one layer
        down and answers "attached" (``taskq_bridge.UNKNOWN_PENDING``), so that
        cause reaches the sweep as an ordinary attached verdict and its
        per-key "still has sub-agent work" line, not as this warning.

        records as startup + shutdown, so a gateway that keeps running holds
        every mapping it publishes until it restarts — one per released session,
        and a recycled pid number goes on carrying a dashboard slot's key. The
        pass itself needs nothing added; it needs a caller on a bounded cadence,
        which is what :data:`MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS` makes this one.

        The cadence lives here rather than on a provider teardown deliberately,
        even though a teardown is the moment a runtime is known dead.
        ``_untrack_session_pid`` is synchronous and ``AcpClient._reset_state``
        calls it on the event loop, so a mapping read or unlink placed on that
        stack is filesystem work on the loop over predictable same-uid
        agent-writable paths — the whole of
        ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``, where a planted FIFO or reparse
        point parks the gateway. On the maintenance executor the same pass needs
        no per-syscall bounding at all, and the one case a teardown hook cannot
        reach — a gateway that dies without running one — this pass covers too.
        The cost is latency: a released session's mapping survives at most one
        tick rather than vanishing with its process.
