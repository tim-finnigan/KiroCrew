"""Full new-path dispatch: FeishuTransport -> TurnDriver -> FeishuRenderer.

``FeishuTransport.receive()`` authorises + normalises an inbound message and
hands the ``LarkInbound`` (carrying the ``message_id`` reply anchor) to
:meth:`FeishuDispatcher.handle_message`, which mirrors the WeCom transport
dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact)
    -> construct FeishuRenderer
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft/hard threshold notice)
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

Feishu has no interactive buttons, so the dispatcher runs the driver
``decider``-less (deny-by-default for INTERACTIVE; ``auto`` still
auto-approves) and has no callback handler.  The security ``tool_gate`` and
the ``spawn_run`` auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

Dependency direction is ``feishu -> messaging`` (allowed).
