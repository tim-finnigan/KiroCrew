"""Rewrite kiro agent specs so MCP servers route through the broker.

The rewriter reads ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` and ``*.md`` (the markdown form,
see :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_spec_format`) and writes modified JSON copies into
the overlay directory (``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``). The overlay is
always ``<stem>.json`` whatever the source's form: ``session_servers.py`` looks
an agent's overlay up by ``<agent>.json``, and a markdown spec's servers must
be stubbed exactly like a JSON spec's or they would spawn direct, outside the
tool gate. The host
filesystem remains untouched — the broker stubs in these specs are injected
into each kiro-cli session over ACP ``session/new``, which outranks the
same-named entry in the agent spec (see ``session_servers.py``).

Servers in :data:`UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS` are left unwrapped. The set is empty, so
nothing is excluded through it; the first-party servers that bind
``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` stay unwrapped only because nothing lists them in the
stub allowlist.

The rewrite is fingerprint-cached: a content-signature snapshot of every input is
kept at ``<overlay_dir>/.rewrite-fingerprint``, and a boot whose inputs all
match serves the previous run's overlays (and its cached ``target_env``)
instead of re-parsing, re-resolving and re-writing everything. The prune
pass runs on both paths. Any doubt — torn file, missing output, unresolved
command — falls through to the full rewrite.

    A spec's ``command`` for one of Kiro Crew's own servers cannot be authored

    version (Toolbox: ``~/.toolbox/tools/kirocrew/<ver>/bin/kirocrew``; macOS
    payload: ``.../backend-dist/kirocrew-backend-<arch>/bin/kirocrew``), so the
    only hand-writable spelling is the bare launcher ``kirocrew``. That
    resolves through the shared Toolbox dispatcher (``toolbox-exec``), a
    different file from the versioned binary, and
    ``gatewayd._spawns_own_control_plane`` -- which compares the spawned
    binary by realpath against exactly this managed entry -- then denies the
    session token: every ``kirocrew-core`` / ``kirocrew-cron`` tool answers
    ``identity_unattested`` while the server LOOKS mounted. A
    spec pinned to a versioned path fails the same way one upgrade later, when

    This weakens nothing downstream: the daemon's gate still runs on the

    encodes, not only the injection: the agent's own spec (an ``autoApprove``
    entry removed, a server disabled) and the policy knobs
    ``_build_stub_entry`` bakes into each stub's argv (``--sandbox-mode``,
    ``--approval-mode``, ``--poolable``, the work dir, the socket, the identity

    must not wait for the next boot, so a keep is only honest when nothing it

    The settings entry is the ONE input compared conditionally, and only because
    a transient fault is what makes it unanswerable: ``_rewrite_inputs_fingerprint``
    signs that file with ``_stat_sig``, which returns ``None`` when it cannot be

    by a stale injected entry is an absorbed instruction, not a deferred edit.
    Every other input is compared unconditionally, so a new fingerprinted input is
    covered without being enumerated here.

    size, mtime or digest and so is invisible to a signature. A keep must offer
    the same guarantees or it becomes a way to have a tampered overlay served,
    and a loosened sidecar ACL left unrepaired, by inducing one transient fault.

    This covers the pass-wide set: the env sidecar directory, every recorded

      interpreter move or a user-site policy change regenerates the overlays.

      actually written as the overlay ``command`` on Windows. A volume's 8.3
      name generation being toggled (or the alias stripped with ``fsutil

    * ``pool_identity_env`` — decides which secret-prefixed keys are hashed into
      the PoolKey and passed on stub argv, so editing the list must regenerate
      the overlays. Without this, naming a key would take effect only once some
      unrelated input changed, and until then the stub would keep hashing the old
      set while gatewayd hashed the new one — the coherence gate would refuse to

    (see :func:`_rewrite_inputs_fingerprint`) the rewrite loop is skipped and
    the cached ``(results, target_env)`` is returned; the stale-file prune
    still runs on that path.

    Args:
        source_dir: Usually ``~/.kiro/agents/``.
        overlay_dir: Usually ``<config_dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/``. Created
            if missing. Cleared of stale files not in ``source_dir``.
        socket_path: Absolute path to the gateway unix socket.
        work_dir: Default cwd passed to the stub (and used in PoolKey
            hashing). Created if missing; gatewayd sets it as the backend
            process's ``current_dir``.
        sandbox_mode: Value from ``config.agent.sandbox`` — fed through
            so the stub's PoolKey matches KiroCrew's sandbox policy.
        approval_mode: Value from ``config.agent.approval_mode`` — same.
        stub_servers: Server names from ``config.mcp_gateway.stub_servers``.
            A stdio server gets a stub when its name is in this set — that list is
            the ONLY trigger. A per-agent-spec ``poolable: true`` is retired and
            deliberately ignored here: both real gates (the broker start gate and
            the session overlay) read the config list, so honouring the spec key
            produced a stub nothing pointed at. It is still stripped before the
            entry reaches kiro-cli, and still reported as ``entry_poolable`` for
            information only. An unstubbed server is left untouched for the
            session to launch itself, which is what keeps the default free of both
            a daemon and a stub process. ``None`` is treated as an empty set,
            meaning nothing is rewritten at all.
        pooling_enabled: ``config.mcp_gateway.enabled``. Sharing is global over
            the stub set: when ``False`` no stub is marked shareable, so each
            connection gets its own backend while the stubs stay in place — the
            state that lets a stubbed server render UI without co-tenancy.
        approvals: The operator's approved launch fingerprints
            (:mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.launch_approval`). When given, only an
            approved launch is wrapped, a cache-served result that names an
            unapproved target is discarded for a full pass, and the object
            records what the pass captured and refused for the caller to
            persist. ``None`` enforces nothing.

    Returns:
        A ``(results, target_env)`` tuple:

        * ``results``: mapping ``{agent_filename: wrapped_server_count}``.
          Agents with no MCP servers are omitted.
        * ``target_env``: mapping ``{KIROCREW_MCP_TARGET_<SERVER>: "cmd arg arg"}``
          suitable for ``GatewaySpec.mcp_target_env``. Gatewayd consults
          these when a stub registers, to find the real backend command
          to spawn for a new pool key.
