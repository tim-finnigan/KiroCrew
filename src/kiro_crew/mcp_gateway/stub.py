"""KiroCrew MCP stub — shim between kiro-cli and the gateway daemon.

The stub is the shim kiro-cli execs in place of the real MCP binary. It
connects to gatewayd over a unix socket, Registers with a full
:class:`PoolKey` payload, then bridges kiro-cli stdio ↔ gateway until
either side closes. On handshake failure it logs a structured fallback
record to ``$KIROCREW_HOME/logs/stub_fallback.jsonl`` and hands the session
to the real MCP backend, preserving per-session correctness: ``execvpe`` in
place on POSIX, and on Windows -- which has no in-place exec -- a child
inheriting this process's stdio (see :func:`_fallback_spawn_child`).

Register fields match :meth:`PoolKey.from_register`; hashes use SHA-256
(stdlib). Bridge phase is NOT wrapped in a timeout (learned correction
— a single timeout around a long-lived session silently kills healthy
streams). Import budget: stdlib + pool + mcp_caller only.

# receives from a registered stub.
_BRIDGE_PING_TYPE = "ping"

# would reproduce the defect it exists to fix.
_ERROR_EMIT_TIMEOUT_SECS = 5.0
_BRIDGE_PONG_TYPE = "pong"
# Reserved type for the gateway->stub keepalive control frame. The gateway
# writes one to every live stub each heartbeat sweep so that a half-open
# transport — which a parked reader cannot observe — fails an actual write and
# becomes detectable. It carries no payload and expects no reply: the write
# succeeding or failing IS the signal, and it is consumed here rather than
# forwarded, exactly like the pong frame above.
_BRIDGE_KEEPALIVE_TYPE = "keepalive"
# --- Reconnect budget -------------------------------------------------------
# What the stub spends trying to re-attach after a live gateway connection dies
# mid-session. The daemon is supervised and respawns itself with its own
# exponential backoff, so one connect attempt would lose the race against an
# ordinary restart.
#
# The two outcomes are NOT symmetric, and the budget is sized by that asymmetry:
#
# * Giving up is IRREVERSIBLE for the session. The terminal exit closes stdout,
#   kiro-cli logs ``Transport to MCP server ... is closed`` and never re-mounts
#   a closed server, so every later call to these tools hangs or fails for the
#   rest of a chat session that may live for hours. The only recovery is a new
#   session -- the user has to notice and act.
# * Waiting is RECOVERABLE. While the stub retries, the stdio transport to
#   kiro-cli stays open and newly arriving requests are buffered (see
#   ``StubSession.next_line``) for ``_QUEUED_GRACE_SECS``, long enough that an
#   ordinary restart serves them for real; past that each one is failed with the
#   same retryable ``-32603`` a call already in flight gets, so the SESSION
#   keeps waiting while no individual CALL waits longer than the live bridge
#   would have let it (see :func:`_drain_while_disconnected`). Under overload the
#   system queues and waits -- it trades time for capacity -- rather than dying.
#
# So the budget has to outlast not one supervisor respawn but a short CRASH LOOP
# of them: a supervisor that kills and respawns gatewayd ten times inside half an
# hour leaves the endpoint absent for around ten minutes, and a budget of one
# minute takes the terminal exit there, so every long-lived session loses
# kirocrew-core for the rest of its life. One kill->respawn cycle, by the
# supervisor's own constants:
#
#   detection   ``manager._LIVENESS_PING_INTERVAL_SECS`` (30)
#               x ``manager._LIVENESS_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES`` (3)  =  90s
#   shutdown    ``TOTAL_SHUTDOWN_BUDGET_SECS`` (SIGTERM->SIGKILL grace) =  20s
#   backoff     ``manager._RESPAWN_BACKOFF_MAX_SECS``                  =  60s
#   start       cold daemon start until the endpoint is bound          ~  10s
#                                                                        ----
#                                                                        180s
#
# Three such cycles is 540s; the budget is rounded up to 600s. The manager
# values are MIRRORED here by name rather than imported: ``manager`` pulls in
# ``config.paths``, ``sandbox`` and ``code_fingerprint``, which is far more than
# the stub's cold-start import budget allows. ``TOTAL_SHUTDOWN_BUDGET_SECS``
# lives in a stdlib-only leaf and IS imported. ``test_stub_reconnect_budget.py``
# pins the mirrors to the manager's real values so they cannot drift silently.
#
# The budget is still finite: a gateway that is gone for good must eventually
# reach the terminal exit rather than leave the session parked on a socket
# nobody will bind again. It is also not a cover for every conceivable recovery:
# a respawn that keeps failing backs off to 60s per retry with no attempt cap, so
# a pathological gateway can still outlast this. The trade is deliberate -- past
# ten minutes the honest signal to a waiting session is that its tools are gone,
# not more silence.
#
# The deadline bounds when new ATTEMPTS stop, not the exit itself: an attempt
# already under way when it passes runs to its own end, so the exit can trail the
# budget by up to the handshake (``_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS``) plus the replay
# (``_REPLAY_INIT_TIMEOUT_SECS``) plus one backoff step
# (``_RECONNECT_BACKOFF_MAX_SECS``) -- about 43s today; the queue-aware
# pre-flight in between is clipped to the budget still remaining, so it adds
# nothing of its own. That is deliberate: abandoning a handshake that is
# mid-replay would throw away the most likely successful attempt in exchange for

# before the peer is declared dead. Sizing it from that constant rather than
# picking a number also means it cannot drift away from the patience the rest of

# is served for real, so the error path is reached only by the crash loop the

    Runs CONCURRENTLY with :func:`_reconnect` and is the only consumer of
    kiro-cli's stream for that window, because ``run_bridge`` -- and with it the
    ``stdin_pump`` that normally reads the session queue -- has already returned.
    Without this, a request issued in that window sits in the queue unread for as
    long as the reconnect runs: not forwarded, not failed, and indistinguishable
    from a hang. That is the whole defect; the in-flight half is already answered
    by ``_split_abandoned_ids`` + :func:`_emit_error_frames` before the reconnect
    starts.

    Each frame is HELD first and failed only if ``grace_secs`` passes with the
    bridge still down, so the common case -- an ordinary restart that re-attaches
    in a few seconds -- forwards the call and answers it for real. Nothing is
    forwarded from here: held frames go back to the session
    (:meth:`StubSession.push_front`) and the next bridge sends them in order.
    A frame that WAS failed is dropped instead, because forwarding an id after
    answering it would let the new daemon answer it a second time.

    Three kinds of frame are never failed, only held: a notification (no id to
    answer), an unparseable line (it is forwarded verbatim, as ``stdin_pump``
    does), and ``initialize`` (the replay answers it for real). ``grace_secs`` is
    a parameter purely so a test need not wait the real window.

    Holding is bounded in BOTH dimensions -- ``_STDIN_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`` frames and
    ``_HELD_TOTAL_BYTES`` of them, with ``_HELD_FRAME_BYTES`` per frame -- because
    either bound alone leaves a hole (see :func:`_no_room_to_hold`). At a bound the
    frame is not held, and what happens then depends on whether it can be
    answered: a request is failed immediately, and a frame with no id is dropped
    and logged. Holding is only the courtesy that lets a quick reattach serve a
    call for real, so it is what yields under pressure -- never the answer.

    The ending is COOPERATIVE -- the caller sets ``stop`` and waits -- and that is
    load-bearing rather than tidy. This loop removes a frame from ``held`` when it
    answers it, so a cancellation landing inside the answering ``await`` would
    leave that frame neither forwarded nor reliably answered: a silent hang, the
    one outcome this function exists to remove. A stop is only ever observed
    BETWEEN iterations, so an answer in flight always completes. Everything still
    held is handed back in the ``finally``.

    is loaded into this process and keeps its pid. Windows has no such call, so
    the ``exec*`` family is emulated as spawn-then-exit: the backend comes up
    under a NEW pid and THIS process dies. kiro-cli owns this process's stdio
    pipe and waits on the pid it spawned, so that exit reads to it as the server
    hanging up -- it reports ``connection closed: initialize response`` and the
    server's whole tool surface is missing from the session. The degrade path was
    fatal on the one platform it existed to rescue, and every stubbed server
    failed while every directly-launched one worked.

    Run the backend as a CHILD and stay alive as its parent instead. Its stdin,
    stdout and stderr are this process's own fds, duplicated into it explicitly
    (``close_fds`` blocks handle inheritance on Windows, so passing the numbers
    is what guarantees the child gets the real pipe rather than a fresh
    console). kiro-cli therefore talks to the real backend over the pipe it
    already holds, and the pid it waits on lives for the session. Every
    ``fallback_exec`` call site is reached with kiro-cli's ``initialize`` still
    unread -- the stub's own "clean per-session exec" invariant, asserted by the
    comments at each of those sites -- so the hand-off loses no buffered request.

    Resolve the command against the CHILD's ``PATH``, because that is what
    ``execvpe`` searches; Windows ``CreateProcess`` would search this process's
    instead, so a relative command could otherwise resolve differently on the
    two platforms. An unresolvable name is passed through unchanged so the
    resulting ``FileNotFoundError`` still surfaces, matching ``execvpe``.

    ``sys.exit()`` cannot be used here. The ``stub-stdin`` daemon thread parks

    same ``BufferedReader``. CPython cannot acquire the lock and aborts the
    process with ``Fatal Python error: _enter_buffered_busy`` (SIGABRT, exit
    134, core dumped) instead of returning ``code``.

    Finalization is skipped, so do its two jobs that matter here explicitly:
    ``logging.shutdown()`` drains handler buffers (the only handler is a
    ``StreamHandler`` on stderr, configured in :func:`_amain`), then stderr is
    flushed. stdout is deliberately NOT flushed here: every stdout frame is
    written and flushed by the dedicated ``stub-stdout`` daemon writer thread,
    which holds the buffer's lock while blocked on a stalled downstream pipe —
    flushing from this thread would deadlock on that lock and the process
    would never reach ``os._exit``. Nothing else is owed — the
    atexit-registered thread-pool joins in ``kiro_crew.executors`` hold no
    unflushed state, only threads the OS reclaims, and skipping them also
    drops a teardown hang risk on a wedged filesystem read.
