"""Full new-path dispatch: IMessageTransport -> TurnDriver -> IMessageRenderer.

``IMessageTransport.receive()`` suppresses own messages, fails closed on group
chats, authorizes the handle, then hands the ``IMessageInbound`` (carrying the
chat selector) to :meth:`IMessageDispatcher.handle_message`, which mirrors the
Webex/WeCom transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact, /help)
    -> construct IMessageRenderer + on_turn_start (read receipt + typing)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft/hard threshold notice)  # guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

iMessage has no interactive buttons, so the dispatcher runs the driver
``decider``-less. That alone would leave the ``INTERACTIVE`` ladder denying
every tool, so ``ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session`` carries the process-global
safety-override grant (``auto``/``trust`` modes still auto-approve on their
own). Every message this module sends is plain text, because iMessage renders no
markup.

Dependency direction is ``imessage -> messaging`` (allowed).
