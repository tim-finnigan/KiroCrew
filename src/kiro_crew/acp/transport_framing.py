    while a reader that has stopped consuming is a dead runtime. The bound matters
    most on the shared runtime: one stdin serves every multiplexed session, so a
    flow-control-paused kiro-cli (busy on one lane, not reading stdin) that held
    the write lock across an unbounded drain would wedge every other session's
    stdin write behind the lock at 0 CPU while the busy lane kept streaming stdout.

    A request stall is reported with the phase it hit. The caller does NOT kill
    the child on a ``DRAIN_STALL`` to make a buffered frame undeliverable: that
    cannot be guaranteed (a close/EOF keeps flushing the buffered bytes, and the
    wedged child is exactly the one that will not exit within a kill grace, so
    death is not confirmed before the raise), and on the shared runtime signalling
    the child from a write path bypasses the ownership authorization + teardown
    barrier and would terminate sibling sessions. Instead the phase sets a RECOVERY
    HINT: a ``DRAIN_STALL`` raises its death flagged ``ambiguous_delivery`` (a
    kiro-cli that merely paused reading could still consume the buffered frame),

    delivered never runs its tools twice, even though it produced no host-visible
    output for the ``turn_emitted`` guard to see. A ``LOCK_STALL`` wrote no byte,
    so it is NOT ambiguous and the replay (its first and only delivery) is safe:

    * ``OK`` -- the frame drained; nothing to recover.
    * ``LOCK_STALL`` -- the stall landed while waiting for the write lock, BEFORE
      ``before_write`` and the ``stdin.write``: no byte of this frame reached the
      transport.
    * ``DRAIN_STALL`` -- the frame was handed to the transport and the DRAIN made
      no progress: the bytes may sit buffered in a kiro-cli that could resume. The
