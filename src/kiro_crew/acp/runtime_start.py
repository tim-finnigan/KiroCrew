# ``_ColdStartAdmission`` above bounds runtime spawn + initialize. This bounds
# the OTHER expensive start: ``session/new`` on an already-running runtime,
# which blocks while kiro-cli initializes the session's MCP servers. Under a
# burst of subagent starts every session/new competes for the same process,
# each one gets slower, and the 90s budget is hit by requests that would have
# completed in isolation -- a timeout that says nothing about the runtime's
# health. The gate keeps at most ``agent.session_start_concurrency`` (default 2)
# session/new requests outstanding per event loop; waiters are ordered by
# ``StartPriority`` (rule: ``kiro_crew.start_priority``).
# It is a FIXED semaphore on purpose: the adaptive loop lives in the gatewayd
# spawn gate and the execution-cap controller, and two adapting loops on one
# resource oscillate. The same gate serves every harness (kiro-cli, KAS, a
# later Claude host): it wraps ``create_session``, which every backend's
# session start runs through.

# How many of the gate's permits are RESERVED for a ``session/new`` that has not
# gone out yet, expressed as a shortfall from the limit: a
# :class:`StartCollector` may hold at most ``limit - this`` permits.
#
# Without the reservation the gate starves. A timed-out start does not release
# its permit -- it hands it to a collector that keeps it for
# ``agent.start_collect_timeout_secs`` (default 300 s) -- so at the default
# limit of 2, two slow starts park BOTH permits for five minutes and every
# session/new on the whole gateway queues behind them, including the retries
# those failures produce, whose own timeouts create more collectors. Observed on
# an operator host: one member slot spent 15 consecutive auto-nudge cycles on
# ``session/new timed out after 90s (0/10 MCP server(s) reported)`` while no new
# agent process was ever spawned -- every attempt was waiting in this queue.
#
# Reserving one permit bounds what the collecting population can claim instead
# of letting it become the whole gate. A collector denied the hand-off still
# runs and still owns its request (the session it may yet receive is still
# adopted or torn down); it simply does not hold back-pressure it cannot
# release. At ``limit == 1`` the ceiling is 0, so no collector holds a permit --

# authorization wait. _REQUEST_TIMEOUT is also 30s, so sharing it turns session
# start into a race the client usually loses: kiro-cli creates the session, the
# client gives up a beat earlier, and the slot dies. This must stay comfortably
# ABOVE the backend's 30s OAuth wait plus the initialization tail that follows
# it (observed: remaining servers register within ~1s after the wait; a
# 71-server agent with no pending OAuth completes in ~14s) — do NOT "tidy" it
# back down to _REQUEST_TIMEOUT.
