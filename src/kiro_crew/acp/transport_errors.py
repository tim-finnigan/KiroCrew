    the union of the two terminal auth families this module already recognises:
    ``_is_session_expired`` (401/403, expiry wording, rejected bearer token) and

    no retry refreshes a login — so for the single question "is this stderr an
    auth problem" they belong together.

    This exists because the two auth vocabularies had drifted apart by call path,
    not by intent. Everything above was reachable only from the error-frame path;
    the spawn / ``session/new`` path had its own detector matching the single

    Keeping one detector rather than widening the banner regex is the same
    anti-drift argument the module makes for its other shared patterns: a second
    vocabulary is what created the gap.

    :func:`kiro_crew.credential_errors.is_credential_propagation_delay` is the
    single carve-out: an auth-shaped rejection a retry DOES fix, so latching it
