#:
#: The ceiling is what makes this a backoff rather than a mute. It is asserted below to

#: the loop still attempts more often than once a window -- a backoff must never become
#: a second way for a backup the owner enabled to go quiet, which is the same rule
#: :func:`_a_day_since_last_run` follows when it reads an unparseable stamp as due.

    This is the record whose absence is the reported defect: without it the state
    file holds nothing at all about a nightly that has been failing since a
    particular day, so :func:`due_for_nightly` cannot tell a fault it has already
    met from one it is seeing for the first time, and the loop re-attempts on every
    wake forever.

    ``run_witness`` is :func:`nightly_run_witness` read BEFORE the attempt began, and it
    is REQUIRED rather than defaulted. A default would let a call site added later opt
    out of the race protocol silently, which is the shape of the bug it exists to close:
    the two writers serialize under the sidecar lock, but each mutate re-reads fresh
    state, so an unconditional write here can land AFTER a concurrent manual success
    cleared the count and record a failure against a kind that just succeeded.

    What that costs was MEASURED rather than assumed, because the obvious claim is wrong:
    the raced write restarts the count at 1, :func:`nightly_retry_delay_secs` answers 0
    there, and the fresh run record already holds the account not-due for the window --
    so it withholds no attempt. What it does produce is a false :func:`nightly_failures`
    row for an account that just backed up, plus a one-step skew on the next genuine
    failure. The row is the reason this guard ships: making that state readable is half
    of what this change is for, so writing a knowingly false one would undo it at the
    surface it just built.

    Returns ``None`` when the slot moved during the attempt, having written nothing. That
    direction is deliberate: skipping a real failure costs the extra attempts the loop
    already makes today, while writing a false one publishes a failure row against an
    account that just backed up and skews the next genuine failure's count by one, so
    every ambiguity here resolves toward attempting the backup -- the same posture
    :func:`_backoff_withholds` and :func:`_a_day_since_last_run` take.

    SCHEDULED callers only, and that is the same line
    :func:`_unattended_sessions_redaction_gap` already draws one screen up: an owner
    pressing the button is present, sees the failure, and chooses whether to try
    again, so recording their attempt here would let a person retrying by hand push
    out the unattended schedule they are retrying on behalf of. What the owner path
    does reach is the CLEAR, inside :func:`_record_run_locked` -- a success counts
    from anywhere, a failure only counts where nobody was watching.

    Never raises, by the rule :func:`_record_run` follows on the same state file:
    this runs on a path that is already handling a failed backup, so letting an
    unwritable state file raise here would replace a logged failure with an
    unhandled one and cost the caller its audit record. A count that did not
    persist leaves the loop retrying as it does today, which is the direction this
    whole change is careful to fail in.

    ``None`` when nothing stands in the way. Redaction is opt-IN and off by

    is not an oversight: the destination is owner-only and re-verified at every
    upload, so the documented trade is that hardening protects the payload and
    redaction is a rewrite an operator may additionally ask for.

    The asymmetry this closes is narrow and only exists for an operator who DID
    ask. :func:`run_snapshot_backup` routes its payload through
    ``snapshot.prepare_redacted_copy`` and so honours the switch; the sessions
    archive cannot use that seam, because it refuses an archive with more than one
    root ("expected one bundle root to redact") and this one has two, ``crew`` and
    ``cli``. So for that operator the snapshot leaves redacted and the transcripts
    would leave unredacted -- while transcripts are the payload most likely to
    hold a pasted secret in the first place.

    Refusing rather than uploading, because ``_redacted_upload_copy``'s own rule
    is that "could not redact" must never fall through to "send it unredacted",
    and unattended is exactly where nobody is present to notice that it did.
