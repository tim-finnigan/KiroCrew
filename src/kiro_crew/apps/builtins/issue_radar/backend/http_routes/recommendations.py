    ``ui_language`` is a validated BCP-47 tag (see :func:`_ui_language`); ``""``

    ``description`` are deliberately excluded: /labels/create writes both onto
    the GitHub repo itself when a proposal is applied, and repo content should
    follow the repo's own label language, not one operator's dashboard setting.

    The prompt deliberately presets NO naming style. Real repos are split across
    several mutually incompatible conventions — flat (`bug`), slash namespaces
    (`kind/bug`), colon+space (`Type: Bug`), hyphen prefixes (`type-bug`), and
    single-letter codes (`A-diagnostics`) — so any house style we hardcode is
    wrong for most repos, and a proposal that does not look like it belongs in the
    repo's existing list is useless however well-named it is in the abstract.
