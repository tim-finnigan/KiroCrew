    The dashboard's default is "follow the browser", which the SPA resolves
    client-side in ``resolveLanguage()``. The backend has no locale transport of
    its own — ``Accept-Language`` is read nowhere — so it cannot reach that
    answer by itself, and every prose surface stays English on an install that
    never set a language explicitly. The SPA therefore sends the tag it ALREADY
    resolved as a per-request hint.

    Per-request and NOT persisted is the whole point. "Auto" is browser-relative,
    so writing a resolved tag into ``dashboard.language`` would tell a *different*
    browser, with different ``navigator.languages``, to discard its own explicit
    pick — the incoherence ``website/src/i18n/LanguageProvider.tsx`` is written to
    prevent. A hint dies with its request, so each browser steers only its own
    prose. It also keeps the catalog matcher in ONE language: the SPA sends a
    concrete tag, so nothing here re-implements ``detect.ts``.

    Validated through the same gate as the configured value
    (:func:`kiro_crew.context.normalize_ui_language_tag`) — this value arrives
    from the client on every AI call, so a malformed or unshipped tag must append
    nothing rather than paste client-supplied text into a model prompt.

    An ``en`` hint resolves to ``""`` deliberately. The directive-free prompt
    already produces English, so an English browser's hint carries no
    information — while honouring it would restamp every unconfigured install's
    caches from ``""`` to ``"en"`` on upgrade, discarding summaries whose prose is
    already in the right language. Suppressing it keeps the default install
    byte-identical, prompts and caches alike, and still reaches every
    non-English implicit locale.
