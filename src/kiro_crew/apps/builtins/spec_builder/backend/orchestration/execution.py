"""Execute and Stop: starting an autonomous build and halting it.

Execute claims the run before any side effect, arms its bounded nudge loop
through the shared authorization chokepoint, and dispatches only after a final
identity, claim and alias check; every refusal after the claim unwinds exactly
what that request created. Stop publishes its revocation before waiting for the
directory lock, so it wins against a handoff suspended mid-authorization.
