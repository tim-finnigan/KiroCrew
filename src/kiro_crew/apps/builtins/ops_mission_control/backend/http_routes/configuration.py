Everything here decides what the agent may do, which of its crons run, or where this app's

    **Any userinfo at all, not just a password.** The first version of this checked
    ``parts.password`` only, reasoning that a bare ``user@`` is a username rather than a
    secret. That was wrong, and wrong in the shape that matters most: GitHub's own documented
    token remote puts the PAT in the USERNAME position —
    ``https://ghp_xxx@github.com/org/repo.git`` — with no password at all. So the single
    likeliest way an operator pastes a token was the one shape explicitly allowed through, and
    a test asserted that as correct. Found in review.

    On http(s) there is no case where userinfo is worth storing in a world-readable file: a

    - **ssh:// with a user**: ``ssh://git@github.com/org/repo.git`` — userinfo, but SSH
      authenticates by key, so the username is not a secret.

    Parsed with ``urlsplit`` rather than matched by hand: the authority ends at the first

    The keystone policy store refuses rather than publishing over a read it could not

    aiohttp's default 500 -- a plain-text body with no ``code``, which the repo requires
    on an error response. On this route the ambiguity is the security-relevant part:
    ``mode`` and ``autonomy_rules`` ARE the authorization ceiling, so "did my change
    land?" is exactly the question the operator cannot be left guessing about. 503 rather
    than 500 because the condition is transient and retrying is correct.

    Accepts ``**kwargs`` so the one write here that takes keyword arguments
    (``policy_store.set_ceiling``, which must stay a single call to commit ``mode`` and
    ``autonomy_rules`` under one lock) goes through this same path rather than being
    spelled out a second time beside it.

    NOT every store behind this handler has that guarantee yet. ``set_top_level`` writes
    the app config, whose read still collapses a failure to ``{}`` -- so on a transient
    ``config.json`` read failure it truncates the file and returns 200 without this
    helper ever seeing an ``OSError``. The strict read that closes it is in the companion
    PR for ``providers/__init__.py``; the ``app_config_unwritable`` code here covers only
    the write-side failure that store can already raise today. Do not read this helper as
    proof of coverage it does not have.

    The refusal reports ``applied`` to the AUDIT LOG rather than in the response body.
    Phase 2 is a SEQUENCE of writes, so an earlier one may already have committed and a
    partial ceiling apply is a security state worth recording -- but the dashboard's own
    ``req`` helper reads only ``error`` from a non-2xx body and discards the rest, so a
    field there would have had no reader. The audit line has one, and it mirrors the

    EVERY FIELD IS VALIDATED BEFORE ANY FIELD IS WRITTEN. The handler is two phases with
    nothing interleaved: phase 1 parses and validates into locals and can only ``return 400``;
    phase 2 performs the writes and cannot fail validation. This took three rounds to get
    right, and the shape of the mistake repeated each time, so it is worth stating plainly:

    - Round one: ``mode`` was written before the rules were validated, so ``mode=act`` plus one
      malformed rule wrote the mode, returned 400, and left the instance in ``act`` —
      activating whatever grants were already stored, from a request the operator was told had
      FAILED.
    - Round two: validating both halves of that PAIR first made the pair atomic but not the
      REQUEST — ``mode=act`` plus an over-long ``ledger_sync_remote`` still persisted ``act``
      and then 400'd. So the ceiling writes moved to the end.
    - Round three (this one): moving only the ceiling was still the wrong scope. Every other
      field had the same defect — ``{"primary_instance": false, "ledger_sync_branch": "--bad"}``
      returned 400 having already flipped leadership, which changes which instance passes the
      ``not_primary`` gate on ``POST /ledger/hygiene``. "Which field is dangerous to
