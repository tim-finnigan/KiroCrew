"""The persisted identity of every spawned backend: ``app_backends.pids.json``.

App backends run in their OWN session (``start_new_session=True``) and are NOT in the
gateway's process group, so when the liveness probe SIGKILLs a wedged gateway (no
``on_cleanup`` runs) they orphan, reparent to PID 1, and accumulate across restarts.
Each spawned backend's ``(pid, start_time, port, spawn_instance)`` is therefore
persisted here and the next clean start reaps the survivors of a PRIOR generation

    Adoption otherwise keys on two facts that say nothing about the code the
    listener runs: the port the manifest declares, and a health answer on it. A
    backend that outlives its app's uninstall and rebinds that port satisfies both,
    so the next install that happens to use the same app name adopts it -- the
    gateway then addresses a process the install did not place as that app's
    backend, reports its health as the app's, and aims stop at its PIDs.

    The record that closes it already exists: every backend this gateway spawns is
    written to the app pidfile as ``pid`` + ``start_time`` + per-spawn
    ``spawn_instance``. Attribution asks whether every captured owner matches that
    record; a survivor of an earlier install that rebound the port is not in it, so
    it is refused and the misattribution the issue describes does not happen.

    Two routes attribute ONE owner, and either is enough for that owner:

    ``leader`` -- the owner IS the recorded pid and its live start instant still
    equals the recorded one. A pid plus a start instant names one process for good,
    so this route answers on every platform, and it attributes that pid alone.

    ``tree`` -- the owner's exec-time environment carries the recorded
    ``spawn_instance``. The whole spawn tree inherits that token, so this route
    reaches a pre-fork worker or a detached child still holding the port after its
    leader has exited. It reads ``/proc/<pid>/environ``, which exists on Linux
    alone; :func:`group_vouching_available` reports that, and the reason names it
    so an operator can tell "not ours" from "this host cannot see".

    EVERY owner must clear a route, because every owner the caller captured enters
    the managed set and is signalled at stop. A same-UID ``SO_REUSEPORT`` co-binder
    lands in the same dispatch tier as the real backend, so attributing the set from
    one match would hand stop an unrelated process to terminate -- and the start-time
    token stop re-checks was captured at the same moment, so it confirms that
    bystander rather than excluding it.

    FAILS CLOSED, uniformly: no recorded spawn, an unreadable pidfile, a row
    carrying neither usable identity, an empty owner set, and any owner no route
    attributes all return ``False``. Refusing costs a start on a port the gateway
    does not own, which the caller reports; adopting on an unproven listener is the
    defect itself.

    Returns ``(attributed, reason)``. *reason* is a short phrase for the log and the
    audit trail on both verdicts.
