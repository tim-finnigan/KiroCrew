"""Field metadata and value coercion shared by every config section owner.

``_meta`` builds the metadata a section field carries into the schema and the
config surfaces, and the ``_safe_*`` readers turn a raw ``config.json`` value
into the field's type or its default without raising. This is a leaf module: it
imports nothing from ``kiro_crew``, so each section owner depends on it without a
cycle, and ``config.sections`` re-exports every name.
