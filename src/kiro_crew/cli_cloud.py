"""CLI ``kirocrew cloud`` command group — thin dispatchers into :mod:`cloud`.

Every verb here is a small wrapper that calls into the testable ``cloud/``
engine. No AWS logic lives in this file. The verbs are **human/installer
actions, never LLM tools** — they are not registered as MCP tools, and the
destructive AWS CLI verbs (``aws ec2 terminate-instances`` / ``ec2 delete-*`` /
``cloudformation delete-stack``) are blocked for the agent by the
``deniedCommands`` regexes in ``config/defaults.json`` (kiro-cli enforces them
on ``execute_bash``/``shell``), not by ``security.py``'s underscored
``BUILTIN_DENY_PATTERNS``.
