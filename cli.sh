# Installs the prebuilt `kirocrew` wheel for a release channel. It resolves the
# channel feed, verifies its RSA-SHA256 signature against the public key pinned
# below, downloads the wheel over HTTPS from CloudFront, verifies its SHA-256
# against the signed digest, then installs it (pipx if available, else a managed
# venv). No unsigned/checksum-only fallback exists. Unlike install.sh (which
# builds from a git clone), this pulls the published wheel.
#
# Python: provisions a python-build-standalone CPython via a SHA-256-pinned uv
# into a user-owned directory (the default) — no package manager, no sudo,
# works on old-glibc distros (CentOS 7). Opt out with --system-python to run on
# a system interpreter (>=3.12) instead; the choice is recorded and survives
# updates. If the managed default cannot be provisioned (no network), the run
# falls back to a usable system interpreter rather than failing.
#
# Dependencies: installed from prebuilt wheels ONLY (`pip --only-binary=:all:`),
# so the install never needs a C compiler or -dev headers. A host no wheel of a
# dependency can run on fails with a supported-platform message before any
# build starts; KIROCREW_ALLOW_SOURCE_BUILDS=1 opts back into compiling.

Installs the prebuilt `kirocrew` wheel for a release channel: resolves the
channel feed, verifies its signature against the installer-pinned public key,
downloads the wheel over HTTPS, verifies its SHA-256 against the signed digest,
then installs it (pipx if available, else a managed venv BESIDE the data home —
"$KIROCREW_HOME"-venv or ~/.kiro/crew-venv, never inside the data home itself).
Records the channel in the data home. There is no unsigned fallback.

# ── Progress output ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The slow steps (the wheel download, pip resolving and fetching every
# dependency, `python -m venv` running ensurepip) take a minute or more; a
# single static line in front of that silence reads as a hang. Under
# `curl ... | sh` only STDIN is the pipe; stdout is still the terminal, so the
# script can tell an interactive run from a logged one and draw accordingly.
#
#   _tty            1 when stdout is a terminal that can take a redrawn line.
#   CURL_PROGRESS   curl's progress flag for artifact downloads: a progress bar
#                   on a terminal, silent (as before) in a log.
#   _run_step LOG MSG CMD...
#                   runs CMD with stdout+stderr captured to LOG. On a terminal
#                   it redraws one line: spinner, MSG, elapsed seconds and the
#                   last line CMD wrote (pip's "Collecting ..." / "Downloading
#                   ..." lines, so the user sees which package it is on).
#                   Otherwise it prints one heartbeat line every 30 s so a CI
#                   log still shows the step is alive. Ends with a "done"/
#                   "FAILED" line and returns CMD's exit status; the caller
#                   reads LOG for the failure report, exactly as before.
#                   Ctrl-C (or TERM) during the step terminates CMD and
#                   everything CMD forked first (CMD runs in its own process
#                   group): CMD runs asynchronously, and POSIX starts an async
#                   child of a non-interactive shell with SIGINT ignored, so
#                   without this the keypress would stop the spinner while
#                   pip kept writing the venv. CMD then exits by signal
#                   (status 128+N), the same status a foreground pip returns
#                   for the keypress, so the caller's restore-then-err path
