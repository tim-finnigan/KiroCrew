/**
 * Small info glyph that reveals a help tip.
 *
 * One pattern for every surface, so a reader learns it once:
 *   - mouse:    hover shows the tip and holds it while the pointer is on the
 *               glyph or the bubble; leaving both hides it;
 *   - keyboard: focus shows it, Escape or blur hides it;
 *   - touch:    a tap pins it, another tap (or a tap elsewhere) unpins it.
 * A click on the glyph pins on any input, and a click inside the bubble does
 * nothing but stay out of the row beneath, so selecting and copying text keeps
 * the tip open. A pinned tip closes on a pointer down outside it, focus leaving
 * it, or Escape pressed anywhere. There is no dismissal latch: every close
 * clears the hover and focus reveals, and the next real hover or focus shows
 * the tip again. While the tip is shown it is the glyph's accessible
 * DESCRIPTION (`aria-describedby`); while hidden, the same text sits on
 * `title`, the native fallback that is also what assistive technology falls
 * back to for a description -- so the help is attached whether or not the tip
 * is open, and nothing of it is in the body copy until it is. The `title` is
 * dropped the moment the tip shows, so the browser's own tooltip never doubles
 * it. Portal-rendered to escape overflow clipping.
