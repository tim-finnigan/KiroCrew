/**
 * The Voice panel's two-level shape, and the disclosure primitive under it.
 *
 * The panel used to render about nineteen equally-weighted rows, each with its own
 * one-to-three lines of explanation. Nothing was broken and nothing was missing --
 * that WAS the problem: a reader had no way to tell which rows carried a decision
 * from which ones carried a default that already worked.
 *
 * So the contract these tests pin is a shape, not a behaviour: the surface holds
 * only the decisions a user has to make, and everything else is reachable but not
 * spending their attention. A regression here does not throw or misread -- it just
 * quietly puts a knob back on the surface, which is exactly the kind of change a
 * diff review waves through.
