/**
 * The one row the workspace tree puts under an expanded folder that has
 * nothing beneath it.
 *
 * The listing (`GET /api/project/tree`) arrives whole: there is no per-folder
 * request, so whether a folder has children is decided by the payload the
 * moment it lands, never by a fetch in flight. What the payload can leave
 * childless is a folder that is
 *
 *  - `empty`: listed as a directory with no file and no subfolder in it;
 *  - `hidden-only`: not empty on disk, but every entry in it is a folder the
 *    listing filters out by nature (a dot-directory, a tooling cache) -- the
 *    server names these in `hiddenOnlyDirectories`, and without that signal
 *    `_bg/` holding only `.kiro/` would be called empty;
 *  - `linked`: it is a symlink to a directory. A visible, navigable entry, so
 *    the server lists it as a row of its own (and its folder is not hidden-only
 *    for holding it), but the walk never follows a link, so nothing beneath it
 *    is listed -- the server names these in `linkedDirectories`, and without
 *    that signal the link would be called empty;
 *  - `truncated`: it has contents, but the workspace row cap (files and
 *    folders together) left it none, or the server stopped reading before it
 *    reached the folder -- the server names these in `truncatedDirectories`.
 *
 * A folder the server could not read (`unreadableDirectories`) gets NO state
 * row: that value is the outcome of a failed read, and an error is
 * reported to the user only through `ErrorNotice` with the agent hand-off (the
 * wrapper renders one above the tree naming the folders) -- a status line
 * inside the widget can carry neither. The folder is still a row of its own
 * (the server lists it in `directories`), skipped here so it is never called
 * empty either; the wrapper gives that row a lock marker whose accessible
 * label points at the notice ("see the notice above") -- a signpost to where
 * the failure is reported, not a report of it -- so the reader can tell it
 * from the folders that show nothing for another reason.
 *
 * `@pierre/trees` renders rows for paths and has no slot for a status line, so
 * each state row is fed to the model as ONE synthetic child path whose
 * basename is the label followed by `STATE_ROW_MARKER`. That buys the widget's
 * own indentation, virtualization and keyboard reachability for free; the
 * wrapper keeps the row inert (no open, no selection, no context menu) and
 * `PIERRE_TREE_STATE_ROW_CSS` styles it as a status line. While the panel's
 * filter is active the wrapper feeds only the rows whose FOLDER matches the
 * query (`stateRowsMatchingFilter`): a status line is never a search result in
 * its own right, and a matched folder -- which Pierre force-expands -- never
 * opens over nothing.
