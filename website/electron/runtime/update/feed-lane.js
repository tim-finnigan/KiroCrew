   * WHY an install needs this. Discovery downloads eagerly (auto-download is on
   * by default) and then WAITS — for a click, or for the next natural quit. The
   * feed keeps moving in that window, and the other supersede checks are driven
   * by the 4-hourly poll, so an install landing between two polls has no fresh
   * verdict of its own to act on. Without this call it applies the stale stage:
   * the app relaunches on an already-superseded build, the next poll finds the
   * newer one, and the whole ~350MB transfer runs a second time — two downloads
   * and two restarts to reach a version one download reaches. The
   * deferred-install-on-quit path needs it most, since nothing between "Later"
   * and the quit consults the feed otherwise.
   *
   * It drives an ORDINARY check rather than parsing the feed itself, so the
   * verdict comes from exactly the logic every other check goes through — the
   * direction gate, the retraction path in `update-not-available`, and the
   * supersede path in `update-available` that drops a stale stage. The answer

   * is also what keeps this from becoming a second, divergent copy of the
   * "is this worth installing" rule.
   *
   * A check ALREADY in flight is waited for rather than re-issued (safeCheck
   * refuses to re-enter one), bounded by the same timeout: its answer is the one
   * this gate needs, and returning "unknown" without waiting would leave that
   * check live at the dispatch, where the quit path then refuses to install.

   * already downloaded must not become uninstallable because the network went
   * away, so an unanswerable feed installs what is staged. A stage that carries
   * no version is "unknown" too, since there is nothing to compare. Only a
   * POSITIVE answer that the stage is gone stops an install.
