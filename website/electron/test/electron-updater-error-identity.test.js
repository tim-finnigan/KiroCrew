// Tripwire for the one library premise the updater's error attribution rests on.
//
// `runtime/update/feed-lane.js` tells a check's own failure from the installer's by comparing the
// error OBJECT (`err === abandonedError`, `err === inFlightCheckError`). That only
// works because electron-updater hands the SAME object to the `error` event and to
// the rejection of `checkForUpdates()`. Nothing in the library documents that, and
// every unit test in this repo mocks the updater, so a version bump that rewrapped
// the error would silently turn a check's feed failure back into a reported install
// failure — firing the host's gateway recovery mid-dispatch, which is the hazard the
// comparison exists to prevent.
//
// So assert it against the REAL installed library, at the source level. An upgrade
// that changes the shape fails here, loudly, with a pointer to what to re-read —
// rather than in production on a user's machine.
