// occupancy reaches its verdict through a process's claim about what it is.
//
// The decisions are listed out below rather than discovered by parsing the
// source. A list is honest about what it covers, and it is safe here because of
// the guard that follows it: every comparison against one of these sentinels
// must be CLAIMED by an entry in a list, and one that is not claimed fails the
// pin. So a fifth decision cannot join the file quietly -- it reddens this test
// and someone has to decide which list it belongs in. Unclassifiable means deny,
// not allow, which is the same rule the rest of this surface follows.
