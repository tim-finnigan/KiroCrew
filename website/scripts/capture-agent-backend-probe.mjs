 * is static, so these are still PNGs rather than video.
 *
 * ## Why the scenes are fixtures rather than this machine's real state
 *
 * The panel composes TWO independent server facts, and one of the three verdicts
 * each fact can carry is unreachable on any single host: a public build never
 * reports `claude` as selectable, and `installed: "unknown"` only happens when the
 * probe itself raises. Shooting only the local truth would leave the two lines this
 * change exists for undocumented. Every scene below is therefore a payload the
 * server can genuinely emit; the FIRST one is this machine's real answer, recorded
 * from an unmocked probe call, and the others vary one field from it.
