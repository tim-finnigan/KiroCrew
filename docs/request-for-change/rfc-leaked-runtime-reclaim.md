# RFC: Leaked Runtime Reclaim — one reconciler, install-scoped ownership proof

- Status: draft. Acceptance requested from a maintainer; the status flips to `accepted` when one records it here. Step A of the rollout is on main as #15755 and needed no record because it adds no default kill authority. Steps B and C extend what the gateway kills by default, and the First Principles lane reads that decision from the base branch, so this document lands on its own first.

- Related: #14510 (the reconciler's kill arm, which predates this RFC), `src/kiro_crew/runtime_reconcile.py`, `src/kiro_crew/runtime_ownership.py` (`authorize_runtime_kill`), `src/kiro_crew/session_pid.py` (`_is_untracked_managed_agent_orphan`), `src/kiro_crew/session_scope_reap.py` (`instance_slice_pids`, `reap_abandoned_agent_scopes`)

## Summary

An agent runtime that outlives its session and is absent from every record is a leak no sweep ends. On a busy host these leaks pile up until the host runs out of memory and the gateway restarts. This RFC settles who may kill such a process, on what proof, and in what order the authority rolls out.

The answer is one reclaim arm for unowned runtimes: the runtime reconciler already on main. It gains a second source of candidates (non-cgroup Linux hosts) and a second kind of proof (a persisted, install-scoped spawn record), and nothing else gets a kill path. Main's second kill arm, the cgroup scope reaper, comes under the same refusals (Decision 1) rather than keeping its own parallel check. The user can see the leak on the dashboard and reclaim it once, by hand, through the same gates.

## Motivation

### Current state (measured at `4224aa2336`)

Three arms look at the unowned population.

| Arm | Where | Sees | Acts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reconciler | `runtime_reconcile.py` | pids in this install's agent cgroup slice (`instance_slice_pids`) | kills, default budget `DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS = 5` per pass |
| Scope reaper | `session_scope_reap.py`, `reap_abandoned_agent_scopes` (every cleanup tick, through `reap_agent_scopes` in `session.py`) | whole transient scopes in the same slice | stops a scope that passes its four-part check (the module docstring of `session_scope_reap.py`) |
| Untracked report | `session_pid.py`, `_is_untracked_managed_agent_orphan` | init-reparented runtimes with `KIROCREW_SPAWNED` and no PID-file row, POSIX only (`_our_orphan_pids` returns `[]` on Windows) | logs; since #15755 also feeds the reconciler reading and the confirmed reclaim (Linux only, `RECLAIM_PLATFORM` in `runtime_reconcile.py`) |

The reconciler requires five conditions before a signal: this install's spawn marker, unowned on the previous pass too, older than `DEFAULT_MIN_AGE_SECS` (300 s), an argv naming a managed harness, and `authorize_runtime_kill` allowing it. `session.reconcile_max_kills` can only lower the budget; at `0` it audits each would-be kill as `would_kill` and signals nothing.

Each ACP runtime spawn mints a `KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE` token (`acp/runtime.py`, held as `_process_instance`) and, since #15755, stamps it beside `KIROCREW_SPAWN_HOME` (this data home) on the child's environment. For runtimes neither value is persisted by the gateway. App backends already persist the same token beside pid and start time in their pid file (`apps/backend_runtime/pidfile.py`, `_record_app_pid`), which is the precedent this RFC follows.

### Problems

1. Non-cgroup Linux hosts have no default reclaim. `instance_slice_pids` returns the empty set when the slice cannot be resolved, and the reconciler then compares nothing. The report arm sees these leaks; only a user-confirmed reclaim (#15755) can end them.
2. Proof dies with the gateway. Leaks cause OOM, OOM restarts the gateway, and after a restart no in-memory token can vouch for anything the previous process spawned.
3. Two arms with two vocabularies. A fix that adds a kill to the report arm (the closed #12612) builds a second, parallel kill path beside the reconciler, and every review round found another live shape that passed its checks.
4. The user cannot see a leak on the dashboard. The reading and the confirmed reclaim are API-only.

## Goals

- One kill path for unowned runtimes, with one set of refusals.
- Ownership proof that survives a gateway restart and cannot authorize a kill on its own.
- Default reclaim on Linux hosts with or without cgroup delegation.
- A visible leak count and a user-confirmed reclaim on the dashboard.

## Non-goals

- Tracked teardown and app-backend stale reap. Those paths end what their records name and stay as they are.
- macOS and Windows default reclaim (see Decision 5).
- Reclaim across installs. A process another data home spawned is never ours.
- Raising the per-pass budget above `DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS`.

## Decisions

### 1. One reclaim arm: the reconciler

The reconciler in `runtime_reconcile.py` is the only code that kills an unowned runtime by pid. The report arm in `session_pid.py` stops being a separate verdict: its hits become a candidate source the reconciler reads, and its output becomes part of the reconciler's reading. It gains no signal of its own.

The scope reaper (`reap_abandoned_agent_scopes`) is main's second kill arm today: it stops whole abandoned cgroup scopes on its own four-part check (no member tracked or active, every member carries our marker or descends from one inside the scope, the group leader is dead or the scope predates this gateway's boot, and the scope is past its grace floor — the module docstring of `session_scope_reap.py`). This RFC folds it under the one rule set: a scope it would stop must pass Decision 4's refusals before any kill, so the slice source, the non-cgroup source and the scope reaper answer to one list of refusals rather than three parallel checks. Its scope-level reads survive as a candidate source and a pre-filter, not as a second verdict. The refusals subsume its own check with margin: condition 1 ("no member tracked or active") is the tracked refusal, and the kernel scope the reaper reads keeps a detached `setsid` child or a live runtime's group member inside that runtime's scope, so the session-leader and group-leader refusals reject the same live shapes its grace floor and marker test were guarding against.

Reason: the reconciler already carries the two-pass confirmation, the age floor, the managed-argv check, the lease gate, the budget and the observe switch. A second arm — whether the closed #12612 or the scope reaper's own four-part check — would have to re-derive each refusal and would drift from it; #12612 conflicted with main twice in the week the reconciler landed. One rule set is the RFC's whole point, so main's two half-overlapping checks become one.

### 2. Kill authority: default-on, budgeted, with an observe switch

Reclaim stays default-on with the per-pass budget `DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS`. `session.reconcile_max_kills=0` remains the observe switch and keeps its meaning on every new candidate source: evaluate every gate, audit `would_kill`, signal nothing.

Reason: a leak that nothing ends grows until the host fails, so a default of off leaves the reported failure in place. The budget makes a reconciler that is wrong about a population wrong slowly, and the switch gives a shared-data-home host the reading without the signal. Main already ships this default on cgroup hosts; this RFC records it as the decision and extends it to the hosts in Decision 5.

### 3. Ownership proof is install-scoped and subtractive

A runtime counts as "ours" only through a persisted spawn record written per data home. Each row holds the minted `KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE` token, the root pid and the root's spawn start time. A candidate qualifies when its environ token matches a row and its current start time equals the row's.

The record is subtractive only. A missing row, a token mismatch, a start-time mismatch or an unreadable record means no kill. A matching row can veto nothing it does not already veto and authorizes nothing by itself: the candidate must still pass every gate in Decisions 1 and 4.

Reason: install scope is what survives the restart that leaks cause (Problem 2), and the data home is already the install boundary the agent slice is keyed on. The token proves the tree is ours; the start time proves the pid is still the same process. The record lives in a same-uid-writable file, so it must never be able to grant a kill an agent could not cause anyway; keeping it subtractive caps the damage of a forged or stale row at a missed reclaim.

### 4. Refusals that always win

The reconciler refuses a candidate when any of these hold:

| Refusal | Proof read |
|---|---|
| Leased or under tenancy | `authorize_runtime_kill` returns false |
| Session leader alive | the candidate's sid names a live process, other than the candidate, that is still that session's leader |
| Group leader alive | the candidate's pgid names a live process, other than the candidate, that is still that group's leader |
| Tracked or protected | the pid is in a PID file or `register_protected_pid` |

A sid or ppid value never grants a kill. Both are read only to refuse. "Still the leader" matters: a measured leak's launcher is dead, and once its pid number is reused a plain liveness test would refuse that leak forever. `_work_orphan_session_leader_alive` reads it this way (`leader_sid == sid`), and so does the reclaim's session check (`_session_leader_alive` in `runtime_reconcile.py`). The reclaim's group check (`_group_leader_alive`) reads liveness only and gains the same `getpgid(pgid) == pgid` test in step B. The scheduled slice arm applies the lease gate and the tracked check; these refusals apply to every candidate the reconciler kills — the slice source, the non-cgroup source and a scope the folded reaper hands up (Decision 1) — so all three answer to one list.

Reason: every real bug the lanes found in #12612 had one shape. The env stamp is inherited, so "carries our stamp" is true of a live runtime's descendants too, including a detached `setsid` child and a member of a live runtime's group. These four refusals cover each live shape seen so far, and none of them can be satisfied by a value the agent can choose.

### 5. Platforms

| Platform | Candidate source | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Linux, cgroup delegated | agent slice (`instance_slice_pids`) | reclaim (on main) |
| Linux, no cgroup | init-reparented runtimes from the report arm, proven by Decision 3 | reclaim, from step C |
| macOS | report arm log (`KERN_PROCARGS2` marker read) | report only |
| Windows | none | no reading |

macOS stays report-only until it has a native proof of ownership that does not rest on `KERN_PROCARGS2` environ reads in a fast-wrapping pid space. Windows has no reading at all: `_our_orphan_pids` returns `[]` there and `_env_has_kirocrew_marker` has no environ oracle there. It gets a reading only once it has a native candidate source (job objects), and reclaim after that.

Reason: the Linux proof uses `/proc/<pid>/environ`, sid and pgid. Neither other platform offers the same reads at the same cost, and a port that guesses would trade a missed reclaim for a wrong kill.

### 6. User control on the dashboard

The dashboard shows the leaked count and its total RSS, read from the reconciler's reading. A "Reclaim" button, after the user confirms, runs one pass over the current candidates with the same gates. It does not raise the budget above `DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS`, does not skip a refusal, and at `reconcile_max_kills=0` refuses every candidate, as the scheduled arm does.

Reason: the user can decide that a leak should end now. They cannot vouch that it is this install's, so the pass still requires the install stamp (Decision 7, step A). A confirmed pass gives them a way to end a leak on a host where default reclaim is off or not yet reached, without adding a path that bypasses the gates.

### 7. Rollout

| Step | Ships | New default authority | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|---|
| A (#15755, merged) | report arm hits feed the reconciler reading (count, tree RSS); owner-only `GET /api/system/leaked-runtimes` and confirmed `POST /api/system/leaked-runtimes/reclaim`; Linux only | none | a confirmed reclaim ends only a candidate whose `KIROCREW_SPAWN_HOME` equals this data home, and refuses one with no stamp or another home |
| B | persisted per-data-home spawn record (Decision 3) for ACP runtimes | none | after a gateway restart the reconciler reading still names the previous process's leaked runtimes as ours, and a row with a mismatched start time yields no kill |
| C | default reclaim on non-cgroup Linux using the step B record | yes, under this RFC | a non-cgroup host's leaked runtimes are reclaimed within the budget with no manual pass, and `reconcile_max_kills=0` turns it into `would_kill` only |

Each step is its own PR and can be abandoned without the next.

Step A as merged already limits a confirmed reclaim to install-stamped candidates. `RuntimeReconciler.reclaim_untracked` refuses through `_why_not_reclaimable` when the candidate's `KIROCREW_SPAWN_HOME` is absent or differs from this data home. It also refuses when a live session or group leader remains and when a live process outside the candidate's tree holds the same spawn instance. A runtime spawned before the stamp existed reads as not ours and stays report-only. The dashboard button of Decision 6 is not built yet; the two routes are API-only.

## Backward compatibility

`session.reconcile_max_kills` keeps its default (`5`), ceiling and meaning. A data home with no spawn record reads as "no proof" and reclaims nothing new, so step B is inert on its first start and older rows simply never match. The report arm's log line stays beside step A's reading.

## Security considerations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Env-stamp inheritance onto live descendants | stamp only narrows; session-leader, group-leader, lease and tracked refusals decide liveness (Decision 4) |
| PID reuse | start time recorded at spawn and rechecked before each signal; mismatch retracts the row and never signals |
| Same-uid-writable record | record is subtractive (Decision 3); a forged row can only mark a process the agent could already signal, and still faces every refusal |
| Shared data home across installs | observe switch `0` refuses the scheduled arm and the confirmed reclaim alike |
| Same uid, different data home | `KIROCREW_SPAWNED` is shared by every install on the uid, so it never proves ours. The confirmed reclaim refuses unless `KIROCREW_SPAWN_HOME` equals this data home (`_why_not_reclaimable`); step B's persisted record keeps that refusal |
| Population misjudged | per-pass budget `DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS`, two-pass confirmation, 300 s age floor |

## Alternatives considered

- Add the kill to the report arm in `session_pid.py`. Rejected: a second kill path with its own gates, the shape of the closed #12612 (Decision 1).
- Process-scoped proof (in-memory token set). Rejected: lost on the restart that leaks cause (Decision 3).
- Default off everywhere until a user opts in. Rejected: the reported failure is a host that runs out of memory unattended (Decision 2).
- Trust sid or ppid as ownership. Rejected: the sid of a measured leak names a dead launcher, and both values are inherited or reparented (Decision 4).

## Open questions

1. Where the spawn record lives: a new file under the data home or new columns on the existing PID file. Step B decides; either way the record is subtractive.
