# Pipeline Conductor

`kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` is a generated kiro-cli agent that runs one
issue/PR pipeline on one repository as a supervised worker fleet. It picks up
queued work items, stands up one worker session per item, patrols the fleet with
one deterministic probe call per cycle, verifies claimed results independently,
intervenes on stalls, adjudicates blocked items, governs host capacity and
per-item credit budgets, and reports verified greens to the person.

**It never does a work item's work.** Repository edits, builds, and fixes belong
to worker sessions; the conductor writes only its own state beside the pipeline
spec. The generated agent reinforces that operating contract by withholding
`fs_write` and `code`, but this is not an OS-level no-write boundary:
`execute_bash` remains mounted (approval-gated) so it can run the bundled scripts
and maintain conductor-owned state. A work item never goes to `spawn_run`,
`spawn_sub_agents`, `task_run` or `workflow_run`.

The shape is *agent plus agent skill*: the `pipeline-conductor` builtin skill
carries the operating procedure, five bundled scripts carry the bookkeeping, and
the agent carries the judgment. The skill is the procedure of record; this spec
is the contract for the machinery underneath it.

## Components

Long runs can expose a model-designed `task-dashboard` HTML artifact in the
shared chat/Crew Dynamic Dashboard, published by an authorized descendant and
updated under the same slug. This is a presentation of the pipeline's existing
facts, not a new status store or a broader conductor role. The host independently
shows native questions and tool approvals for the session subtree; Normal
permission users can act on an exact request without visiting every worker.
Publishing never changes permissions. See [artifacts](artifacts.md).

## The generated agent

`_install_pipeline_conductor_agent` runs on the same boot path that installs the
other managed agent specs, writing `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor.json` atomically
into the kiro agents directory. It derives from `build_agent_config` and then
narrows, and each narrowing is a permission decision:

- **Tools:** `execute_bash`, `fs_read`, `web_fetch`, `session`, `report`,
  `tool_search`, plus the `@kirocrew-core` and `@kirocrew-dashboard` servers.
  Neither `fs_write` nor `code` is mounted, which is what makes "never does the
  work" structural.
- **`allowedTools` is verb by verb, never a whole server.** The conductor ingests
  untrusted content by design (issue text, PR bodies) on unattended cycles, so a
  server-wide grant would let that content start persistent work or spawn
  arbitrary subagents with nobody in the loop.
- **`mcpServers` is narrowed** to `kirocrew-core` and a hand-built
  `kirocrew-dashboard` entry. That entry carries `type` in registry mode (a
  registry-mode client silently drops an entry without it) and the managed MCP
  env (without the data-home pin the shim reads the default home while the
  gateway runs under an override).
- **`permissions` is derived** from the filtered `allowedTools` through the
  agent-SDK boundary, never restated.
- **A withheld grant is audited.** Every reference is filtered through
  `_may_auto_approve`; anything the governance ceiling withholds is recorded in
  the SEL as `mcp_auto_approve_withheld` and then goes through the ordinary
  approval gate.
- **The operator's own `allowedTools` entries survive the rebuild.** The
  installer runs on every gateway start and reads the spec it replaces: an entry
  the operator added is carried forward after the shipped grants, through the
  same ceiling, while the shipped set itself is re-derived from this release
  (`_governed_grants`). What tells the two apart is the history of every grant
  any release has shipped on this spec (`_SHIPPED_GRANT_HISTORY`, a literal
  table a test pins to contain everything the installers write): an entry it
  names is Crew's and is kept exactly when this release ships it, so a grant a
  release retired is never read back as the operator's; an entry it does not
  name is the operator's and stays. The one cost is a grant Crew once shipped
  and has since retired that the operator hand-re-adds: it reads as Crew's and
  goes, named in the warning and audited as a revoked auto-approval, and the
  tool asks instead. A clean rebuild drops the operator's entries; a rebuild
  that drops any entry logs a warning naming it and a kept operator entry is
  audited as a retained auto-approval. A spec that is present but unreadable is
  not "no spec": bytes that can never be a spec (a JSON typo, a list that is
  not a list) are written over, since kiro-cli could not load them either and
  the ceiling could not be re-filtered onto them, and so is a spec carrying a
  second hard link, which kiro-cli WOULD load while the hardened reader refuses
  it for good (the rewrite swaps the directory entry; the other name keeps its
  bytes); a read that may succeed next time leaves the file in place, named, and
  the installer reports that it wrote nothing — as the rebuild does when the
  installer's write raised — so a moved ceiling stays pending. Not a weakening
  of the withholds above: what Crew ships is unchanged, and an entry the
  operator writes is theirs to write.

Auto-approved core verbs are reads (`resource_status`, `list_sessions`,
`skill_search`, `skill_fetch`), the conductor's own patrol lifecycle
(`monitor_start`, `monitor_update`, `autonudge_stop`, `wait`), its own durable
ledger (`session_ledger_read`, `session_ledger_record`), and reporting to the
owner (`send_message`, `send_notification`, `ask_question`). Auto-approved
dashboard verbs are create-or-read only: `chat_folder_tree`,
`chat_folder_create`, `session_create`, `session_read_message`.

`session_send`, `session_stop` and `spawn_run` are mounted and **never**
auto-approved, even though the intervention ladder uses all three. They start
agent work from ingested context, so unattended operation gets them from the
operator arming the conductor's own session in trust mode, not from a standing
spec-level bypass. `execute_bash` is the same case and is the sharper one in
practice: every script call goes through it, because `allowedTools` cannot match
arguments, so trusting the five bundled scripts cannot be told apart from
trusting arbitrary shell. A conductor session that was not armed therefore stalls
on its first probe, not on its first intervention.

## The pipeline spec file

The operator's seed message names a JSON spec. It is data the conductor reads,
never values inlined from memory, and it is not a modelled type in the codebase
today (see [Not implemented](#not-implemented)). The fields consumed now, shown
with the defaults that apply when the spec omits them:

```json
{
  "id": "issue-fix",
  "repo": "<owner>/<repo>",
  "default_branch": "main",
  "work_source": {"kind": "gh_issues", "select_labels": ["auto-fixable"],
                  "skip_signals": ["claimed", "in-progress"]},
  "worker_contract": {"branch_pattern": "fix/{slug}-{n}",
                      "worktree_pattern": "../{repo_name}-fix-{n}",
                      "max_commits": 2},
  "verifier": {"repro_gate": "best_effort"},
  "governance": {"max_in_flight": 32, "max_per_cycle": 3,
                 "idle_alert_secs": 900, "session_ceiling": 30,
                 "credit_budget_per_item": 100, "topup_ceiling": 2},
  "policy": {"keep_unused_seams": true, "refuse_design_asks": true,
             "refuse_benign_duplication": true},
  "interface": {"folder_name": "pipeline-{id}", "digest_language": "auto"}
}
```

The governance block is what bounds the fleet: a ceiling on dispatched workers, a
per-cycle dispatch limit, the silence a worker may accumulate before the probe
fires `IDLE`, a session budget for the run, a per-item credit allowance, and how
many budget top-ups an item may receive. The `policy` block controls three
intake dispositions: whether deliberately unused seams are retained,
design-decision asks are refused, and benign duplication is left alone. Each
defaults to `true`; setting one to `false` admits that item class. The interface
block names the chat folder the pipeline's sessions live in and the language its
digests are written in. `verifier.repro_gate` selects the campaign's admission
policy — `best_effort`
(the generic contract) or `pod_required` (a live pod repro is a precondition for
implementation, not a score attached afterwards) — and it is the one field with a
closed value set, so `spec_check.py` refuses the run on any third value rather
than defaulting.

The spec file's directory is the run's state home: the probe config is
`<spec-dir>/probe-config.json` and the probe owns
`<spec-dir>/probe-config.json.state.json` as its handled-set. `fleet_worktrees`
is optional in that config and is what makes `cwd=fleet` reachable, so omitting
it classifies every banned-process line as `foreign` or `unknown` and the one
enforcing row of the banned-ops table never fires.

## The bundled scripts

Anything the procedure states as prose rots silently; anything a script computes
can be tested. So every decision the skill delegates is the script's answer to
read, never a predicate for the agent to re-derive.

**`claim_preflight.py`** answers one candidate item with one verdict, branched on
the exit code: `CLAIM` 0, `UNKNOWN` 3, `SKIP` 10, `CLOSE` 11, `REVIEW` 13. Two
rules are load-bearing. `UNKNOWN` is never permission. And `REVIEW` is a closure
request read out of the item's prose, which the conductor confirms itself,
because prose never closes an item.

**`coverage_filter.py`** answers the same coverage question as
`claim_preflight.py` check 2, for MANY candidates in one forge call, so the queue
build can drop covered items instead of rediscovering them one dispatch at a
time. Its evidence is the repository's open pull requests (title and body, fork
and draft PRs included) rather than the item's timeline, and the rule that makes
two evidence sources safe is that this one only ever SUBTRACTS. It answers in
three parts rather than two. `COVERED` is a positive finding and removes an item,
and it requires a CLOSING KEYWORD aimed at the item in a pull request's own title
or body. `MENTIONED` is a reference carrying no closing keyword: the item STAYS in
the queue and the reference is reported. `UNCOVERED` certifies nothing. A bare
reference is deliberately not coverage, because `Refs #N` is this repository's own
idiom for referenced-but-deliberately-not-closed and its PR template keeps
`Related Issues` apart from a closing trailer; measured over one real candidate
list, 3 of 21 (item, covering PR) pairs carried no closing keyword and all 3 of
those PRs disclaimed the fix in their own words. `MENTIONED` stays a separate line
from `UNCOVERED` because a declined subtraction printed as `UNCOVERED` would be
exactly as silent as the subtraction it replaced. An unreadable forge exits 3
printing no `uncovered` list at all, so an unanswered batch cannot render as a
finding about the items. `claim_preflight.py` remains the authority before every
claim.

**`fleet_probe.py`** answers, in one call per cycle, whether anything in the
fleet needs judgment: per-session tail classification, tail index, idle age,
error tails, a banned-process scan, host load, and the delivery counters. Three
properties matter beyond the classification:

- **Paths are derived, never configurable.** Transcripts come only from
  `<data home>/sessions`, the handled-set state file is always
  `<config path>.state.json`, and the banned-process scan reads `/proc`. The
  config is authored without a dedicated file-writing tool (the approved shell is
  still capable of writing conductor state), and a config-chosen path would quietly
  widen what that approved run can reach.
- **Output is metadata only.** No transcript-derived text appears in it, so no
  private session content crosses into the conductor's context whatever keys the
  config watches. Content, when a ruling needs it, is read through the
  workspace-authorized session tools.
- **`i=` is a monotonic per-session production index.** It counts rows that
  session produced, never an inbound nudge or user row, so a supervisor's own
  nudge cannot read as worker progress, and it is counted from the start of the
  file so it does not saturate once a transcript passes `tail_bytes`. The probe
  makes the comparison against the previous cycle itself and fires `NOPROGRESS`,
  rather than leaving two numbers for someone to diff.

A malformed regex in the config is reported as malformed config with the
offending pattern, never a crash mid-cycle.

**`credit_spend.py`** sums the credits an item's sessions burned from the
gateway's usage shards and answers `within`, `exhausted`, `truncated` or
`unmetered`. `exhausted` is monotone (more shards can only add spend, so it
stands on a partial view), and `unmetered` means at least one watched slot had no
shard row, which the caller must treat as unknown spend rather than zero.

**`spec_check.py`** runs once, at startup, over the spec fields whose value set is
CLOSED, and exit 2 refuses the run. It exists because a closed field is the one
shape where a typo is silent: a misspelled repo or threshold fails at first use,
while a misspelled enum matches no branch, so the mode the operator asked for is
off while the spec says it is on. `verifier.repro_gate` is the field that made
this concrete — `pod_required` is the gate that makes unit-only evidence
inadmissible, and `"pod-required"` would leave the generic contract in force
under a spec that reads as gated, with the campaign metric still counting the run
as pod-verified. The check therefore fails closed rather than defaulting to
`best_effort`; the accepted set is declared once, in the script's `_ENUMS` table,
which is also the seam a future closed field registers in. An ABSENT field is not
an error (omission is how a pipeline asks for its documented default), while an
explicit `null` is a value and is refused.

The spec path itself is operator-supplied, so the read is a GATED read: the file
goes through `hooks.safe_read_file`, which re-checks the RESOLVED target against
`is_sensitive_path` and opens it `O_NOFOLLOW`. A `--spec` symlinked at a
credential store is therefore refused through the link (`refused spec: Blocked:
access to sensitive path: …`, exit 2) rather than parsed.

The normal startup invokes this script with the ACP-injected
`KIROCREW_RUNTIME_PYTHON` using `-I -B`, so the interpreter already carries Kiro
Crew while isolated mode keeps ambient import paths and bytecode writes out. A
manual invocation under a foreign interpreter can still miss the gate import; in
that case the script re-execs itself once under the injected runtime or an
interpreter discovered beside the `kirocrew` launcher, and the child's verdict is
the invocation's verdict. Refusal is what remains when the gate is reachable from
no interpreter, because an unenforceable read precondition cannot degrade to a
plain file read.

## The patrol cycle

A `monitor_start` response saying “requested” confirms receipt only. Do not
retry within that turn; confirm activation from the gateway arm notice or a
later `monitor_inspect`. A refusal means no new loop was armed.


The conductor patrols with `monitor_start`, never `wait`, at roughly a 90-second
interval, and arms the loop with both the full cycle instructions and the exit
condition. Two cycle-order rules are structural rather than stylistic:

**The ledger is read at the top of every cycle, before the probe.** The
`[work ledger]` block prefixed onto a nudge turn is a teaser: `render_snapshot`
caps the whole block at 1600 characters, every field at 300, and the `tried` list
at its last 3 entries. A fleet's item table does not fit in that, and every row
of the action table is a comparison against recorded state, so acting first means
dispositioning a fleet against a summary of it.

**Item changes are written back as the whole `artifacts` map in one call.** The
ledger merges per key and keeps only the newest `_MAX_ARTIFACTS` (32) entries, so
a partial write ages an active item out. The corollary the skill states as
"reclaim before you admit": settled entries are collapsed first, so a full map
means no capacity rather than no tidying.

Admission is keyed on **delivery capacity first**, load and memory second. The
probe's `OK` line carries `deliver init-timeout <a>, watchdog <b>`; either
counter appearing twice in one cycle stops dispatching until two consecutive
clean cycles, while in-flight work continues, because what is short is delivery,
not compute. Load and memory can both read healthy while turns are killed by the
stall watchdog and sessions fail to initialize, so admission keyed on load alone
keeps dispatching into a fleet that cannot deliver and the failures then present
as the workers' fault.

Banned-operation lines are reported for every ownership class and **enforced with
a stop only for `cwd=fleet`**. `cwd=unknown` re-injects the directive without
stopping the session, a line with no `cwd=` field gets one attribution attempt at
action time, and `cwd=foreign` is counted only.

## Conductor-owned state

The session ledger records the items. `conductor-status/v1`, written beside the
spec and rewritten whole each cycle, records the conductor's own obligations:
`tally`, `workers` (with `last_index`, the previous cycle's probe `i=`),
`parked`, `open_rulings`, `conductor_tasks`, a bounded `events_tail`, and the
last `resource` posture.

Per-item state, session keys and PRs are the **ledger's**, cached here for one
cycle's fleet view; when the two disagree the ledger wins and this file is what
gets fixed. Two independent spellings of item state would drift, and the drift
would be silent.

Two more conductor-owned artifacts live beside the spec, opened empty at
startup: `decisions.md`, one line per decision
(`<ts> | <subject> | <decision> | <reason>`) appended at the moment the decision
is made, and the run's retrospective, appended in the cycle a lesson happens.
They are the durable record, and they exist because every alternative is a
tail: `events_tail` is a bounded, newest-first mirror of the most recent
`decisions.md` lines, and the session ledger keeps `_MAX_EVENTS` = 100 events on
disk while `session_ledger_read` returns only the newest `_MAX_EVENT_TAIL` = 20
(`session_ledger.py`), so neither can hold a whole run's rulings.

`open_rulings` is reviewed every cycle independently of what the probe fired.
That is structural: the probe is right not to re-fire a signal already marked
handled, and that suppression is what keeps a quiet cycle quiet, so a worker on
an escalation hold goes silent by design and a debt the conductor owes becomes
invisible unless it keeps its own list.

## Failure modes

- **An absent script reads as `UNKNOWN`, never as permission.** Presence is
  checked at first use rather than assumed, so an install that does not carry a
  script loses that script's answers instead of gaining a default yes.
- **The patrol expires silently.** `monitor_start` defaults to 24 cycles, so a
  90-second patrol runs out in well under an hour, long before a fleet drains,
  and the loop simply stops with no symptom. `max_cycles` is passed explicitly
  and raised mid-run with `monitor_update`. Coasting into the cap is a failure,
  not a finish, so `autonudge_stop` is called deliberately.
- **The conductor cannot detect its own loop's death from the inside.** The
  procedure bounds what recovery it can and says so.
- **Credit metering covers dashboard-session turns only.** Inspector `spawn_run`
  turns and non-chat sessions burn invisibly, which is why `unmetered` exists as
  a distinct verdict.
- **Forge labels and assignees are the cross-operator lock.** The ledger is a
  cache and never the authority on anything another operator can also touch.
- **An agent without a dedicated write tool still needs a read boundary.** The
  approval-gated shell can maintain conductor state, so every probe path is derived
  rather than configurable precisely because the config is agent-authored.

## Not implemented

The design of record is
[`../../request-for-change/rfc-pipeline-conductor.md`](../../request-for-change/rfc-pipeline-conductor.md)
(status `partial`). M0 is what ships and what this spec documents: the generated
agent, the builtin skill, its five scripts, and the `conductor-status/v1`
schema. Unbuilt, and deliberately not described above as behaviour:

- **M1:** a modelled PipelineSpec type and a SQLite event store. That type has
  no code hit outside the RFC; the spec file is read as plain JSON by the agent.
- **M2:** adjudication and SLA machinery as code. Adjudication today is the
  skill's protocol plus the status file, not an engine.
- **M3:** baking, compensation and per-repo objects.
- Five RFC decisions remain open.

Related but separate: `issue_radar_crew_read` / `issue_radar_crew_record` are the
**Issue Radar** app's own repository crew ledger, owned by
[issue-radar.md](issue-radar.md). The pipeline conductor does not mount them and
is not granted them; its durable state is the session work ledger
([session-work-ledger.md](session-work-ledger.md)) plus
`conductor-status/v1`. The work-ledger tool family generalized from the Issue
Radar one, proposed in
[`../../request-for-change/rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md`](../../request-for-change/rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md),
is now built and is what `kirocrew-conductor` runs — but this conductor does
**not** mount it. It was mounted here briefly and the mount was retracted: the
ledger flow binds before it seeds and reads a record instead of a transcript, so
it is a different procedure rather than two extra tools, and this conductor's
children report through the `pipeline-conductor` skill's own scripts.

One sibling agent shares this one's installer mechanics and nothing else:
`kirocrew-conductor` (the `goal-conductor` skill) decomposes a free-form goal and
tracks its items in the work ledger. `kirocrew-ledger-conductor` is a deprecated
alias emitting that same spec under the flow's old name for one release. Both
narrow `mcpServers`, withhold every file-writing tool, grant verb by verb and
derive `permissions` from the filtered list; only the conductor mounts
`kirocrew-work`.
